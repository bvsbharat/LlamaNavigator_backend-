  * [Fix or correct a return](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040x "Fix or correct a return")

Use this tool to check your refund. Your refund status will appear around:

  * 24 hours after you e-file a current-year return
  * 3 or 4 days after you e-file a prior-year return
  * 4 weeks after you file a paper return

## Check your refund

Information is updated once a day, overnight.

### What you need

  * Your Social Security or individual taxpayer ID number (ITIN)
  * Your filing status
  * The exact refund amount on your return

[Check your refund](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/wmr/ "Check your refund")

**Prefer a mobile app?** You can also check your refund with
[IRS2Go](/help/irs2goapp "IRS2GoApp").

**Find your tax information** in your [online account](/payments/online-
account-for-individuals "Online account for individuals") or get a [copy
(transcript) of your tax records](/individuals/get-transcript "Get your tax
records and transcripts").

**To check an amended return,** visit [Where's My Amended
Return?](/filing/wheres-my-amended-return "Where’s My Amended Return?")

## How it works

Where's My Refund shows your refund status:

  * Return Received – We received your return and are processing it.
  * Refund Approved – We approved your refund and are preparing to issue it by the date shown.
  * Refund Sent – We sent the refund to your bank or to you in the mail. It may take 5 days for it to show in your bank account or several weeks for your check to arrive in the mail.

## Before you file a second tax return

Filing the same tax return again typically won't speed up your refund and
could cause delays.

You should resubmit your tax return, electronically if possible, **only** if
**all** of these apply:

  * You are due a refund
  * You filed on paper more than 6 months ago
  * Where’s My Refund doesn’t show that we received your return.

## When to call us

Call us about your refund status only if Where's My Refund recommends you
contact us.

[IRS phone numbers and tax help options](/help/let-us-help-you "Let us help
you")

## If your refund is delayed

Your refund may be delayed if your return needs corrections or extra review.
If we need more information to process your return, we'll send you a letter.

individual to receive and inspect your confidential tax information.

You can file Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative,

## If you receive an IRS notice or letter

We may send you a notice or letter if:

  * You have a balance due
  * Your refund has changed
  * We have a question about your return
  * We need to verify your identity
  * We changed or corrected your return
  * We’re delayed in processing your return

To get details on an IRS notice or letter, search for it by number or topic.
You can find the CP or LTR number on the right corner of the letter.

## What to do if you get a letter or notice

Review it carefully and keep it for your records. If we ask you to respond,
act by the due date. What to do depends on your situation:

### If you agree with the notice or letter

Take any requested action. You don’t need to reply unless we specifically ask
you to.

### If you disagree

Follow the instructions in the notice to dispute what it says. Include
information and copies of documents for us to review when we consider your
dispute.

To guarantee your appeal rights, reply by the due date.

### If you have an amount due

Even if you can’t pay the full amount you owe, [pay by the due date](/payments
"Payments "). This can reduce interest and penalty charges.

### If we changed or corrected your tax return

Compare the information in the notice or letter with your return. If you
agree, note the corrections on your personal copy of the tax return and keep
it for your records.

You only need to take action if we ask for more information, if you have a
balance due or [if you disagree with the notice](/help/tax-scams/recognize-
tax-scams-and-fraud "Recognize tax scams and fraud").

### If you suspect a scam

If the letter doesn’t appear in your search or if it looks suspicious, call
[800-829-1040](tel:800-829-1040). Follow the IRS representative’s
instructions.

**IRS sends letters disallowing improper ERC claims** –**** As part of
continuing efforts to combat dubious Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claims,
the IRS is [sending letters to thousands of taxpayers notifying them of
disallowed ERC claims](/newsroom/irs-moves-forward-with-employee-retention-
credit-claims-agency-accelerates-work-on-complex-credit-as-more-payments-move-
into-processing-vigilance-monitoring-continues-on-potentially-improper-claims
"IRS moves forward with Employee Retention Credit claims: Agency accelerates
work on complex credit as more payments move into processing; vigilance,
monitoring continues on potentially improper claims").

For more information about how to respond to a disallowance letter, see
[Understanding Letter 105-C, Disallowance of the Employee Retention
Credit](/coronavirus/understanding-letter-105-c-disallowance-of-the-employee-
retention-credit "Understanding Letter 105-C, Disallowance of the Employee
Retention Credit").

**Resolving incorrect claims for the Employee Retention Credit** –**** The IRS
continues to urge employers to review their ERC claims. There is limited time
to resolve incorrect claims without penalties and interest. Resources to check
ERC eligibility:

  *     * [Warning signs of incorrect claims](/newsroom/irs-shares-more-warning-signs-of-incorrect-claims-for-the-employee-retention-credit-urges-businesses-to-proactively-resolve-erroneous-claims-to-avoid-penalties-interest-audit "IRS shares more warning signs of incorrect claims for the Employee Retention Credit; urges businesses to proactively resolve erroneous claims to avoid penalties, interest, audit")
    * ERC Eligibility Checklist ([interactive tool](/newsroom/employee-retention-credit-eligibility-checklist-help-understanding-this-complex-credit "Employee Retention Credit Eligibility Checklist: Help understanding this complex credit") on IRS.gov or a [printable guide PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5887.pdf "0824 Publ 5887                           \(PDF\)"))
    * Frequently asked questions on ERC at [IRS.gov/ercfaq](/coronavirus/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-employee-retention-credit "Frequently asked questions about the Employee Retention Credit")

If their incorrect claim is still pending, they should consider the [claim
withdrawal program](/newsroom/withdraw-an-employee-retention-credit-erc-claim
"Withdraw an Employee Retention Credit \(ERC\) claim") that allows them to
withdraw a pending ERC claim with no interest or penalties.

The IRS announced a [second ERC Voluntary Disclosure Program](/newsroom/irs-
reopens-voluntary-disclosure-program-to-help-businesses-with-problematic-
employee-retention-credit-claims-sending-up-to-30000-letters-to-address-more-
than-1-billion-in-errant-claims "IRS reopens Voluntary Disclosure Program to
help businesses with problematic Employee Retention Credit claims; sending up
to 30,000 letters to address more than $1 billion in errant claims") that lets
businesses that received an incorrect ERC repay 85% of the amount of the
credit without interest or penalties. The program is open through Nov. 22,
2024.

**IRS helps taxpayers by providing penalty relief on nearly 5 million 2020 and
2021 tax returns with unpaid balances** –**** In a major step to help people
who owe back taxes, the IRS announced [new penalty relief for approximately
4.7 million individuals, businesses and tax-exempt organizations that were not
sent automated collection reminder notices during the pandemic](/newsroom/irs-
helps-taxpayers-by-providing-penalty-relief-on-
nearly-5-million-2020-and-2021-tax-returns-restart-of-collection-notices-
in-2024-marks-end-of-pandemic-related-pause "IRS helps taxpayers by providing
penalty relief on nearly 5 million 2020 and 2021 tax returns; restart of
collection notices in 2024 marks end of pandemic-related pause").

The relief will total about $1 billion and most of those receiving it make
under $400,000 a year.

Given the unusual situation due to the pandemic, the IRS is taking several
steps in advance of resuming normal collection notices for tax years 2020 and
2021 to help taxpayers with unpaid tax bills. They include:

  * Issuing a special reminder letter starting next month
  * taking steps to waive the failure-to-pay penalties for eligible taxpayers affected by this situation for tax years 2020 and 2021

This penalty relief is automatic. Eligible taxpayers don't need to take any
action to get it.

**IRS announces delay in Form 1099-K reporting threshold for third party
platform payments** — Following feedback from taxpayers, tax professionals and
payment processors and to reduce taxpayer confusion, the Internal Revenue
Service this week released [Notice 2023-74](/irb/2023-51_IRB#NOT-2023-74
"Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2023-51") announcing a [delay of the new $600 Form
1099-K reporting threshold](/newsroom/irs-announces-delay-in-
form-1099-k-reporting-threshold-for-third-party-platform-payments-
in-2023-plans-for-a-threshold-of-5000-for-2024-to-phase-in-implementation "IRS
announces delay in Form 1099-K reporting threshold for third party platform
payments in 2023; plans for a threshold of $5,000 for 2024 to phase in
implementation") for third party settlement organizations for calendar year
2023. As the IRS continues to work to implement the new law, the agency will
treat 2023 as an additional transition year. As a result, reporting will not
be required unless the taxpayer receives over $20,000 and has more than 200
transactions in 2023.

**IRS ends unannounced revenue officer visits to taxpayers** – The IRS
announced a major policy change that will [end unannounced visits to
taxpayers](/newsroom/irs-ends-unannounced-revenue-officer-visits-to-taxpayers-
major-change-to-end-confusion-enhance-safety-as-part-of-larger-agency-
transformation-efforts "IRS ends unannounced revenue officer visits to
taxpayers; major change to end confusion, enhance safety as part of larger
agency transformation efforts") by agency revenue officers to reduce public
confusion and increase overall safety. The change reverses a decades-long
practice by IRS Revenue Officers, the unarmed agency employees whose duties
included visiting households and businesses to collect unpaid taxes. Effective
immediately, the unscheduled visits will end except in a few unique
circumstances.

**Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan** – The IRS unveiled its
[Strategic Operating Plan](/about-irs/irs-inflation-reduction-act-strategic-
operating-plan "IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan"), an
ambitious effort to transform the tax agency and dramatically improve service
to taxpayers and the nation during the next decade. The report outlines the
agency's historic plans to make fundamental changes following funding from
last year's Inflation Reduction Act.

**2023 tax inflation adjustments** – The IRS announced the [tax year 2023
annual inflation adjustments](/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-
adjustments-for-tax-year-2023 "IRS provides tax inflation adjustments for tax
year 2023") for more than 60 tax provisions, including the tax rate schedules
and other tax changes. [Revenue Procedure 2022-38](/irb/2022-45_IRB#REV-
PROC-2022-38 "Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2022-45") provides details about
these annual adjustments.

**2023 standard mileage rates** – Beginning January 1, 2023, the standard
mileage rates used to calculate the deductible costs of operating a car (also
vans, pickups or panel trucks) are 65.5 cents per mile for business use. For
details, see [IRS issues standard mileage rates for 2023; business use
increases 3 cents per mile](/newsroom/irs-issues-standard-mileage-rates-
for-2023-business-use-increases-3-cents-per-mile "IRS issues standard mileage
rates for 2023; business use increases 3 cents per mile").

## Clean vehicle and energy credits

**New, Previously Owned and Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit** – The
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) made several changes to the new clean
vehicle credit for qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles, including
adding fuel cell vehicles. The IRA also added a new credit for previously
owned and commercial clean vehicles. Get answers to [frequently asked
questions about the new, previously owned and qualified commercial clean
vehicles credit](/newsroom/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-new-
previously-owned-and-qualified-commercial-clean-vehicles-credit "Frequently
asked questions about the New, Previously Owned and Qualified Commercial Clean
Vehicles Credit").

**Home energy credits** – The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) amended
credits for energy efficient home improvements and residential energy
property. Get details on eligible expenditures and how the credit limitations
work in the [frequently asked questions about energy efficient home
improvements and residential clean energy property credits](/credits-
deductions/frequently-asked-questions-about-energy-efficient-home-
improvements-and-residential-clean-energy-property-credits "Frequently asked
questions about energy efficient home improvements and residential clean
energy property credits").

**Alternative fuel credits** – Find rules to make a one-time claim for the
credit and payment allowable for alternative fuels sold or used during 2022
first, second, and third calendar quarters in [Notice
2022-39](/irb/2022-40_IRB#NOT-2022-39 "Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2022-40").
Also get instructions for how a taxpayer's liability for excise tax may be
reduced by claiming the alternative fuel mixture credit allowable for 2022
first and second quarters. The alternative fuel credits are part of the
Inflation Reduction Act.

**Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship** – The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
(IRA) amended and enacted various clean energy tax incentives that provide
increased credit or deduction amounts if certain [prevailing wage and
registered apprenticeship requirements](/credits-deductions/prevailing-wage-
and-apprenticeship-requirements "Prevailing wage and apprenticeship
requirements") are met. Treasury and the IRS published [final
regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-
inspection/2024-13331/increased-amounts-of-credit-or-deduction-for-satisfying-
certain-prevailing-wage-and-registered "Increased Amounts of Credit or
Deduction for Satisfying Certain Prevailing Wage and Registered Apprenticeship
Requirements") and [frequently asked questions](/credits-
deductions/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-prevailing-wage-and-
apprenticeship-under-the-inflation-reduction-act "Frequently asked questions
about the prevailing wage and apprenticeship under the Inflation Reduction
Act") on providing rules and definitions for taxpayers seeking to satisfy the
prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.

**Elective pay and Transferability** – Elective pay allows applicable entities
(as defined), including tax-exempt and governmental entities that would
otherwise be unable to claim these credits because they do not owe federal
income tax, to benefit from some clean energy tax credits by treating the
amount of the credit as a payment of tax and refunding any resulting
overpayment.

**Transferability** allows entities that can't use elective pay but do qualify
for an eligible tax credit to transfer all or a portion of the credit to a
third-party buyer in exchange for cash. The buyer and seller would negotiate
and agree to the terms and pricing.

The IRS has provided an overview and several audience specific posters that
can be found on the [elective pay and transferability landing page](/credits-
deductions/elective-pay-and-transferability "Elective pay and
transferability") and [frequently asked questions](/credits-
deductions/elective-pay-and-transferability-frequently-asked-questions
"Elective pay and transferability frequently asked questions") on providing
rules and definitions for taxpayers seeking to satisfy the prevailing wage and
apprenticeship requirements.

deductions-under-the-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022 "Credits and deductions

status involving special payments made by 21 states in 2022](/newsroom/irs-
issues-guidance-on-state-tax-payments-to-help-taxpayers "IRS issues guidance
on state tax payments to help taxpayers"). During a review, the IRS has
determined that taxpayers in many states will not need to report these
payments on their 2022 tax returns.

and individuals who qualify can still file their 2021 tax return and claim
without penalty some or all of the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit, the Child Tax
Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit and other tax credits. The IRS sent a
letter to [9 million individuals and families who appear to qualify for a
variety of key 2021 tax benefits but did not yet claim them](/newsroom/irs-
sending-letters-to-over-9-million-potentially-eligible-families-who-did-not-

the [Child Tax Credit of $3,600 per child](/newsroom/irs-provides-guidance-
for-residents-of-puerto-rico-to-claim-the-child-tax-credit "IRS provides
guidance for residents of Puerto Rico to claim the Child Tax Credit").

**Tax credits for families revert to 2019 levels** –**** You'll likely receive
a significantly smaller refund compared to last year because the [Child Tax
Credit (CTC)](/credits-deductions/individuals/child-tax-credit "Child Tax
Credit"), the [Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)](/credits-
deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc "Earned Income Tax Credit
\(EITC\)") and the Child and Dependent Care Credit amounts revert to pre-COVID
levels:

  * The CTC is worth $2,000 for each qualifying child for 2022. A child must be under age 17 at the end of 2022 to be a qualifying child.
  * For the EITC, eligible taxpayers with no children who received roughly $1,500 in 2021 will now get $560 for the 2022 tax year.
  * The Child and Dependent Care Credit returns to a maximum of $2,100 in 2022 instead of $8,000 in 2021.

**Premium Tax Credit expanded** – You may be eligible for tax year 2022 under
the temporarily expanded eligibility for the [Premium Tax Credit](/affordable-
care-act/individuals-and-families/the-premium-tax-credit-the-basics "The
Premium Tax Credit – The basics"). You must meet both the income requirements
and the other [eligibility criteria](/affordable-care-act/individuals-and-
families/eligibility-for-the-premium-tax-credit "Eligibility for the Premium
Tax Credit").

**Stimulus payments** –**** There were no new stimulus payments for 2022,
unlike 2020 and 2021.

**No above-the-line charitable deductions** – During COVID, taxpayers were
able to take up to a $600 charitable donation tax deduction on their tax
returns. However, for tax year 2022, taxpayers who don't itemize and who take
the standard deduction, won't be able to deduct their charitable
contributions.

**Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans improperly forgiven are taxable** –
If you inappropriately received forgiveness of your PPP loan, we encourage you
to file an amended return that includes forgiven loan proceed amounts in
income. IRS issued [guidance PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/202237010.pdf
"202237010") that confirms if your PPP loan is forgiven based on
misrepresentations or omissions, you can't exclude the forgiveness from your
income. You must include in your income the portion of the loan proceeds that
were forgiven based upon misrepresentations or omissions.****

IR-2024-212, Aug. 15, 2024

WASHINGTON —The Internal Revenue Service announced today a limited time
reopening of the Voluntary Disclosure Program to help businesses fix incorrect
Employee Retention Credit claims as the agency continues compliance work.

The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) Voluntary Disclosure Program (VDP) will
run through November 22 and allow businesses a chance to correct improper
payments at a 15% discount and avoid future audits, penalties and interest.
During the first disclosure program that ended in March, there were more than
2,600 applications from ERC recipients that disclosed $1.09 billion worth of
credits.

To underscore the importance of participating in the Voluntary Disclosure
Program, the IRS also announced it plans to mail up to 30,000 new letters to
reverse or recapture potentially more than $1 billion in improper ERC claims.
Thousands more mailings on additional questionable payments will be made in
the fall.

“The limited reopening of the Voluntary Disclosure Program provides an
opportunity for those with improper claims to come in ahead of IRS compliance
work and get a discount on repayments,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.
“This is especially important given increasing IRS compliance actions
involving bad claims, many of them are the result of aggressive marketing
tactics to lure unsuspecting businesses into claiming the complex credit. This
provides a final window of opportunity for those misled businesses to make
adjustments and avoid future compliance action by the IRS.”

“The push by promoters flooded the IRS with questionable ERC claims, which
clogged our systems and slowed work,” Werfel added. “We recognize well-meaning
businesses are caught up in this, and we are taking important steps to help
them. This includes reopening the Voluntary Disclosure Program as well as
getting more payments out to qualifying businesses.”

Last week, the IRS announced it was taking [additional steps](/newsroom/irs-
moves-forward-with-employee-retention-credit-claims-agency-accelerates-work-
on-complex-credit-as-more-payments-move-into-processing-vigilance-monitoring-
continues-on-potentially-improper-claims "IRS moves forward with Employee
Retention Credit claims: Agency accelerates work on complex credit as more
payments move into processing; vigilance, monitoring continues on potentially
improper claims") to move forward with ERC, including updates on the
processing moratorium, compliance actions and upcoming payments. In recent
weeks, the IRS separately sent out 28,000 disallowance letters to businesses
whose pending claims showed a high risk of being incorrect. The IRS estimates
that these disallowances will prevent up to $5 billion in improper payments.
The IRS has also identified 50,000 valid ERC claims and is quickly moving them
into the pipeline for payment processing in coming weeks. These payments are
part of a low-risk group of claims.

The ERC program began as an effort to help businesses during the pandemic, but
as time went on, the program increasingly became the target of aggressive
marketing – and potentially predatory in some cases – well after the pandemic
ended. For example, some promoter groups called the credit by another name,
such as a grant, business stimulus payment or government relief besides ERC or
the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) to increase claims. The IRS continues
compliance work on questionable ERC claims on multiple fronts, with thousands
of audits underway and 460 criminal cases initiated.

## ERC Voluntary Disclosure Program reopens; special discount available
through November 22

Today’s announcement features a special reopening of the [ERC Voluntary
Disclosure Program (VDP)](/coronavirus/employee-retention-credit-voluntary-
disclosure-program "Employee Retention Credit - Voluntary disclosure program")
through November 22 to help businesses that received questionable payments to
self-correct and repay the credit they received after filing ERC claims in
error. The IRS urged businesses with claims that show [warning sign
indicators](/newsroom/irs-shares-more-warning-signs-of-incorrect-claims-for-
the-employee-retention-credit-urges-businesses-to-proactively-resolve-
erroneous-claims-to-avoid-penalties-interest-audit "IRS shares more warning
signs of incorrect claims for the Employee Retention Credit; urges businesses
to proactively resolve erroneous claims to avoid penalties, interest, audit")
to review eligibility requirements and talk to a [trusted tax
professional](/tax-professionals/choosing-a-tax-professional "Choosing a tax
professional") to see if the disclosure program is a good option for them.

As the IRS continues intensifying its compliance work involving improper ERC
claims, the disclosure program protects businesses from more costly future
compliance action. The second VDP offers a 15% discount for businesses
repaying credits for tax periods in 2021, a slightly reduced rate from the
first program’s 20% discount that ended in March.

Businesses should act soon to resolve incorrect claims and avoid potential
future issues such as audits, full repayment, penalties and interest. Full
details are available in [IRS Announcement 2024-30
PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-24-30.pdf "A-2024-30"), also released
today, with highlights outlined in another IRS news release, IR-2024-213, [IRS
provides details of second Employee Retention Credit Voluntary Disclosure
Program; program for improper claims open through Nov. 22](/newsroom/irs-
provides-details-of-second-employee-retention-credit-voluntary-disclosure-
program-program-for-improper-claims-open-through-nov-22 "IRS provides details
of second Employee Retention Credit Voluntary Disclosure Program; program for
improper claims open through Nov. 22").

## Thousands of new recapture letters going out for improper ERC claims made
for Tax Year 2021, some Tax Year 2020

As part of ongoing compliance work, the IRS announced today plans to mail
thousands of additional letters reversing or recapturing improperly paid ERC
claims. The IRS currently anticipates this round of mailings could reach up to
30,000 letters this fall. These “clawback” notices potentially represent more
than $1 billion in claims from Tax Year 2021 and some additional, later-filed
Tax Year 2020 claims. These letters notify taxpayers that the IRS is reversing
or recapturing their previous credit. Several thousand of the letters have
been mailed, with more coming in upcoming weeks and into the fall.

The IRS notes that those who receive these recapture letters will be
ineligible to participate in the Voluntary Disclosure Program for the calendar
quarter the letter covers.

This is the second round of these letters. Previously, the IRS determined that
more than 12,000 entities filed claims that were improper for Tax Year 2020,
resulting in $572 million in assessments.

The latest letters generally involve larger claims than earlier letters
regarding 2020 because Congress increased the maximum ERC in 2021. Congress
increased the maximum ERC from $5,000 per employee per year in 2020 to $7,000
per employee for each quarter of the year in 2021.

When the IRS identifies an employer that has received excessive or erroneous
ERC, the agency will reclaim that ERC through normal tax assessment and
collection procedures.

"This new round of letters serves as another incentive for businesses that
believe they received an erroneous Employee Retention Credit payment to come
forward and participate in the disclosure program and resolve the matter on
more favorable terms," Werfel said. “The disclosure program provides a
limited, unique opportunity to avoid future IRS compliance problems as well as
sidestep a significant repayment fee with penalties and interest.”

## Separate ERC Claim Withdrawal Program remains available for those with
pending claims

The IRS also continues to urge employers with pending, unpaid ERC claims to
consider a separate [ERC Claim Withdrawal Program](/newsroom/withdraw-an-
employee-retention-credit-erc-claim "Withdraw an Employee Retention Credit
\(ERC\) claim") that allows them to remove a pending ERC claim – one that the
IRS has not processed yet. They can withdraw the claim and pay no interest or
penalty. Already, the claim withdrawal process for those with unprocessed ERC
claims has led to more than 7,300 entities withdrawing $677 million.

## **ERC compliance work continues**

The IRS continues analyzing ERC claims, intensifying audits and pursing
promoter and criminal investigations. Beyond the disallowance letters, current
initiatives results include:

  * **Criminal investigations:** As of July 1, 2024, IRS Criminal Investigation has initiated 460 criminal cases, with potentially fraudulent claims worth nearly $7 billion. In all, 37 investigations have resulted in federal charges so far, with 17 investigations resulting in convictions and nine sentencings with an average sentence of 20 months.

  * **Promoter investigations:** The IRS is gathering information about suspected abusive tax promoters and preparers improperly promoting the ability to claim the ERC. The IRS’s Office of Promoter Investigations has received hundreds of referrals from internal and external sources. The IRS will continue civil and criminal enforcement efforts of these unscrupulous promoters and preparers.

  * **Audits:** The IRS has thousands of ERC claims currently under audit.

## Limited service: Nov. 9 and 10

We’re making planned updates. This service is unavailable during these times:

  * Nov. 9, 1 a.m.-3 p.m. ET
  * Nov. 10, 1 a.m.-9 p.m. ET

Thank you for your patience.

You can access your personal tax records online or by mail, including
transcripts of past tax returns, tax account information, wage and income
statements, and verification of non-filing letters.

If you need a transcript for your business, find out how to [get a business
tax transcript](/businesses/get-a-business-tax-transcript "Get a business tax
transcript").

## Access tax records and transcripts in your Individual Online Account

You can view your tax records in your [Individual Online
Account](/payments/online-account-for-individuals "Online account for
individuals"). This is the fastest, easiest way to:

  * View, print or download your transcripts
  * Find out how much you owe
  * Look at your payment history
  * See your prior year adjusted gross income (AGI)
  * View other tax records

[Sign in to your online
account](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/ola/tax_records/transcripts "Access tax
records and transcripts in your Individual Online Account CB: Sign in to your
online account ")

**Note:** The method you used to file your tax return (e-file or paper) and
whether you had a balance due affects your [current year transcript
availability](/individuals/transcript-availability "Transcript availability").

## **Alternative to getting a transcript online**

We recommend getting a transcript online since that’s the fastest method. If
you’re unable to register, you can get a tax return or tax account transcript
mailed to you instead.

### **What you need**

To get a transcript mailed to you, you need your mailing address from your
latest return.

### **What you get**

  * Tax return or tax account [transcript types](/individuals/transcript-types-for-individuals-and-ways-to-order-them "Transcript types for individuals and ways to order them") delivered by mail
  * Transcripts that arrive in **5 to 10 calendar days** at the address we have on file for you

[Get transcript by mail](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/oat/ "IRS get transcripts by
mail")

You can also request a transcript be mailed to you by calling our automated
phone transcript service at [800-908-9946](tel:800-908-9946).

For more information, visit our [Transcripts services for individuals -
FAQs](/individuals/transcript-services-for-individuals-faqs "Transcript
services for individuals - FAQs"). If you're trying to get a transcript to
complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), refer to [Tax
information for student financial aid applications](/individuals/tax-
information-for-federal-student-aid-applications "Tax information for federal
student aid applications").

**Note:** Transcripts partially mask your personally identifiable information
to protect you. Financial data will remain fully visible to allow for tax
preparation, tax representation or income verification. Learn more at [About
tax transcripts](/individuals/about-tax-transcripts "About tax transcripts").
If you need a photocopy of your return, submit [Form 4506, Request for Copy of
Tax Return](/forms-pubs/about-form-4506 "About Form 4506, Request for Copy of
Tax Return").

**Caution:** The IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text
messages or social media channels to request personal or financial
information. Visit [Report phishing](/privacy-disclosure/report-phishing
"Report phishing") for instructions if you're unsure about the authenticity of
any unsolicited communication you receive, other than U.S. mail, claiming to
be from the IRS.

For recent developments, see the tax year 2023 [Publication 505, Tax
Withholding and Estimated Tax](/forms-pubs/about-publication-505 "About
Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax").

Taxes must be paid as you earn or receive income during the year, either
through withholding or estimated tax payments. If the amount of income tax
withheld from your salary or pension is not enough, or if you receive income
such as interest, dividends, alimony, self-employment income, capital gains,
prizes and awards, you may have to make estimated tax payments. If you are in
business for yourself, you generally need to make estimated tax payments.
Estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax, but other taxes such as
self-employment tax and alternative minimum tax.

If you don’t pay enough tax through withholding and estimated tax payments,
you may have to pay a penalty. You also may have to pay a penalty if your
estimated tax payments are late, even if you are due a refund when you file
your tax return.

Estimated tax requirements are different for farmers, fishermen, and certain
higher income taxpayers. [Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated
Tax](/publications/p505 "Publication 505 \(2024\), Tax  Withholding  and
Estimated  Tax"), provides more information about these special estimated tax
rules.

## Who must pay estimated tax

Individuals, including sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation
shareholders, generally have to make estimated tax payments if they expect to
owe tax of $1,000 or more when their return is filed.

Corporations generally have to make estimated tax payments if they expect to
owe tax of $500 or more when their return is filed.

You may have to pay estimated tax for the current year if your tax was more
than zero in the prior year. See the worksheet in [Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax
for Individuals](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es "About Form 1040-ES, Estimated
Tax for Individuals") for more details on who must pay estimated tax.

## Who does not have to pay estimated tax

If you receive salaries and wages, you can avoid having to pay estimated tax
by asking your employer to withhold more tax from your earnings. To do this,
file a new [Form W-4](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-4 "Form W-4 ") with your
employer. There is a special line on Form W-4 for you to enter the additional
amount you want your employer to withhold.

If you receive a paycheck, the [Tax Withholding Estimator](/individuals/tax-
withholding-estimator "Tax Withholding Estimator") will help you make sure you
have the right amount of tax withheld from your paycheck.

You don’t have to pay estimated tax for the current year if you **meet all
three** of the following conditions.

  * You had no tax liability for the prior year
  * You were a U.S. citizen or resident alien for the whole year
  * Your prior tax year covered a 12-month period

You had no tax liability for the prior year if your total tax was zero or you
didn’t have to file an income tax return. For additional information on how to
figure your estimated tax, refer to [Publication 505, Tax Withholding and
Estimated Tax](/publications/p505 "Publication 505 \(2024\), Tax  Withholding
and Estimated  Tax").

## How to figure estimated tax

Individuals, including sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation
shareholders, generally use [Form 1040-ES](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es
"About Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals"), to figure estimated tax.
Nonresident aliens use Form 1040-ES(NR) to figure estimated tax.

To figure your estimated tax, you must figure your expected adjusted gross
income, taxable income, taxes, deductions, and credits for the year.

When figuring your estimated tax for the current year, it may be helpful to
use your income, deductions, and credits for the prior year as a starting
point. Use your prior year's federal tax return as a guide. You can use the
worksheet in [Form 1040-ES](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es "About Form
1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals") to figure your estimated tax. You
need to estimate the amount of income you expect to earn for the year. If you
estimated your earnings too high, simply complete another Form 1040-ES
worksheet to refigure your estimated tax for the next quarter. If you
estimated your earnings too low, again complete another Form 1040-ES worksheet
to recalculate your estimated tax for the next quarter. You want to estimate
your income as accurately as you can to avoid penalties.

You must make adjustments both for changes in your own situation and for
recent changes in the tax law.

## When to pay estimated taxes

For estimated tax purposes, the year is divided into [four payment
periods](/payments/pay-as-you-go-so-you-wont-owe-a-guide-to-withholding-
estimated-taxes-and-ways-to-avoid-the-estimated-tax-penalty "Pay as you go, so
you won't owe: A guide to withholding, estimated taxes and ways to avoid the
estimated tax penalty"). Each period has a specific payment due date. If you
don’t pay enough tax by the due date of each of the payment periods, you may
be charged a penalty even if you are due a refund when you file your income
tax return.

If a payment is mailed, the date of the U.S. postmark is the date of payment.
If the due date for an estimated tax payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday, the payment will be on time if you make it on the next day that
isn’t a Saturday, Sunday or holiday.

## How to pay estimated taxes

You may send estimated tax payments with [Form 1040-ES](/forms-pubs/about-
form-1040-es "About Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals") by
[mail](/filing/where-to-file-addresses-for-taxpayers-and-tax-professionals-
filing-form-1040-es "Where to file addresses for taxpayers and tax
professionals filing Form 1040-ES"), or you can [pay online](/payments
"Payments "), by phone or from your mobile device using the [IRS2Go
app](/help/irs2goapp "IRS2GoApp"). You can also make your estimated tax
payments through your online account, where you can see your payment history
and other tax records. Go to [IRS.gov/account](/payments/online-account-for-
individuals "Online account for individuals"). Visit
[IRS.gov/payments](/payments "Payments ") to view all the options. For
additional information, refer to [Publication 505, Tax Withholding and
Estimated Tax](/publications/p505 "Publication 505 \(2024\), Tax  Withholding
and Estimated  Tax").

Using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) is the easiest way for
individuals as well as businesses to pay federal taxes. Make **ALL** of your
federal tax payments including federal tax deposits (FTDs), installment
agreement and estimated tax payments using [EFTPS](/payments/eftps-the-
electronic-federal-tax-payment-system "EFTPS: The Electronic Federal Tax
Payment System"). If it’s easier to pay your estimated taxes weekly, bi-
weekly, monthly, etc. you can, as long as you’ve paid enough in by the end of
the quarter. Using EFTPS, you can access a history of your payments, so you
know how much and when you made your estimated tax payments.

Corporations must deposit the payment using the [Electronic Federal Tax
Payment System](https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/ "EFTPS Site"). For additional
information, refer to [Publication 542, Corporations](/publications/p542
"Publication 542 \(01/2024\), Corporations").

## Penalty for underpayment of estimated tax

If you didn’t pay enough tax throughout the year, either through withholding
or by making estimated tax payments, you may have to pay a penalty for
underpayment of estimated tax. Generally, most taxpayers will avoid this
penalty if they owe less than $1,000 in tax after subtracting their
withholdings and credits, or if they paid at least 90% of the tax for the
current year, or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year,
whichever is smaller. There are special rules for farmers, fishermen, and
certain higher income taxpayers. Please refer to [Publication 505, Tax
Withholding and Estimated Tax](/publications/p505 "Publication 505 \(2024\),
Tax  Withholding  and Estimated  Tax") _,_ for additional information.

However, if your income is received unevenly during the year, you may be able
to avoid or lower the penalty by annualizing your income and making unequal
payments. Use [Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals,
Estates, and Trusts](/forms-pubs/about-form-2210 "About Form 2210,
Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates and Trusts") (or [Form
2220, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Corporations](/forms-pubs/about-
form-2220 "About Form 2220, Underpayment of Estimated Tax By Corporations")),
to see if you owe a penalty for underpaying your estimated tax. Please refer
to the [Form 1040 and 1040-SR Instructions ](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040
"About Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return")or [Form 1120
Instructions PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1120.pdf "2023 Inst 1120
\(PDF\)"), for where to report the estimated tax penalty on your return.

The penalty may also be waived if:

  * The underpayment was due to a casualty, disaster, or other unusual circumstance and it would be inequitable to impose the penalty, or
  * You retired (after reaching age 62) or became disabled during the tax year for which estimated payments were required to be made or in the preceding tax year, and your underpayment was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. For information on how to request a waiver, see [Form 2210 Instructions PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2210.pdf "2023 Inst 2210                           \(PDF\)").

Form 1040 and 1040-SR 
Helpful Hints

For 2023, you will use Form 1040 or, if you were born before January 2, 1959, you have the option to use  
Form 1040-SR.

You may only need to fle Form 1040 or 1040-SR and none of the numbered schedules, Schedules 1 through 
3. However, if your return is more complicated (for example, you claim certain deductions or credits or owe 
additional taxes), you will need to complete one or more of the numbered schedules. Below is a general guide 
to which schedule(s) you will need to fle based on your circumstances. See the instructions for the schedules 
for more information. 

If you e-ﬁle your return, the software you use will generally determine which schedules you need.


IF YOU...
THEN USE...


Have additional income, such as business or farm income or 
loss, unemployment compensation, or prize or award money.

Schedule 1, Part I


Have any adjustments to income, such as student loan 
interest, self-employment tax, or educator expenses.

Schedule 1, Part II


Owe alternative minimum tax (AMT) or need to make an 
excess advance premium tax credit repayment.

Schedule 2, Part I


Owe other taxes, such as self-employment tax, household 
employment taxes, additional tax on IRAs or other qualifed 
retirement plans and tax-favored accounts.

Schedule 2, Part II


Can claim a nonrefundable credit (other than the child tax credit 
or the credit for other dependents), such as the foreign tax credit, 
education credits, or general business credit.

Schedule 3, Part I


Can claim a refundable credit (other than the earned income 
credit, American opportunity credit, or additional child tax credit), 
such as the net premium tax credit. 

Schedule 3, Part II

Have other payments, such as an amount paid with a request for 
an extension to fle or excess social security tax withheld.

The Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Here To Help You

 


What is the Taxpayer Advocate Service?
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is an independent organization within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that helps 
taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights. TAS strives to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and 
understand your rights under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
 
What can TAS do for you?
TAS can help you if your tax problem is causing a financial difficulty, you've tried and been unable to resolve your issue with the 
IRS, or you believe an IRS system, process, or procedure just isn't working as it should. And the service is free. If you qualify 
for TAS assistance, you will be assigned to one advocate who will work with you throughout the process and will do everything 
possible to resolve your issue. TAS can help you if:

• Your problem is causing a financial difficulty for you, your family, or your business.
• You face (or your business is facing) an immediate threat of adverse action.
• You’ve tried to contact the IRS but no one has responded, or the IRS hasn’t responded by the date promised.

 
How can you reach TAS?
TAS has offices in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To find your advocate’s number:

• Go to TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/contact-us;
• Download Publication 1546, Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Your Voice at the IRS. If you do not have Internet access, you 
can call the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676) and ask for a copy of Publication 1546;

• Check your local directory; or
• Call TAS toll free at 877-777-4778.

 
How can you learn about your taxpayer rights?
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes 10 basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. The TAS website 
TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov can help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are your rights. 
Know them. Use them.
 
How else does TAS help taxpayers?
TAS works to resolve large-scale problems that affect many taxpayers. If you know of one of these broad issues, please report it 
to TAS at IRS.gov/SAMS. Be sure not to include any personal taxpayer information.


Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers


Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Taxpayer Advocate 
Service (TAS). LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with 
the IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition, 
LITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak 
English as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see 
the LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/LITCMap or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List. This 
publication is available online at IRS.gov/Forms-Pubs or by calling the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). 


Suggestions for Improving the IRS

 

Taxpayer Advocacy Panel


Taxpayers have an opportunity to provide direct feedback to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through the Taxpayer Advocacy 
Panel (TAP). The TAP is a Federal Advisory Committee comprised of an independent panel of citizen volunteers who listen to 
taxpayers, identify taxpayers' systemic issues, and make suggestions for improving IRS customer service. Contact TAP at 
ImproveIRS.org.

Affordable Care Act—What You Need To Know

Requirement To Reconcile Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit

The premium tax credit helps pay premiums for health insurance purchased from the Marketplace. Eligible 
individuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance 
company.

If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the 
premium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach 
Form 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year.

The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2024, listing the advance payments and other 
information you need to complete Form 8962.

1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace.

2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments.

3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don’t include Form 1095-A.)


Health Coverage Reporting

If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2023, the employer may be required to send you Form 
1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if 
so, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2024. This information may be 
relevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2023 through the Health Insurance Marketplace and 
wish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don’t need to wait to receive this form 
to file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don’t wish to claim the 
premium tax credit for 2023, you don’t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C. For more information on 
who is eligible for the premium tax credit, see the Instructions for Form 8962.


Reminder: Health care coverage. If you need health care coverage, go to www.HealthCare.gov to learn about 
health insurance options for you and your family, how to buy health insurance, and how you might qualify to get 
fnancial assistance to buy health insurance.

If you were serving in, or in support 
of, the U.S. Armed Forces in a designa-
ted combat zone or contingency opera-
tion, you may be able to file later. See 
Pub. 3 for details.

Do You Have To File?

Use Chart A, B, or C to see if you must 
file a return. U.S. citizens who lived in 
or had income from a U.S. territory 
should see Pub. 570. Residents of Puerto 
Rico can use Tax Topic 901 to see if they 
must file.

If you e-file your return, there is no 
need to mail it. However, if you choose 
to mail it instead, filing instructions and 
addresses are at the end of these instruc-
tions.

A child born on January 1, 2000, is 
considered to be age 24 at the end of 
2023. Do not use Form 8814 for such a 
child.

Even if you do not otherwise 
have to file a return, you should 
file one to get a refund of any 
federal income tax withheld. You should 
also file if you are eligible for any of the 
following credits.

if you were a resident alien. Also, you 
may qualify for certain tax treaty bene-
fits. Generally, you are a resident alien if 
you meet either the green card test or the 
substantial presence test for 2023. See 
Pub. 519 for details.

structions provides the current 
address for mailing your re-
turn. Use these addresses for Forms

and both of the following apply.

What if You Can't File on 
Time?

• You were married to a U.S. citizen 
or resident alien at the end of 2023.

You can get an automatic 6-month ex-
tension if, no later than the date your re-
turn is due, you file Form 4868. If you 
want to apply for an extension electroni-
cally, see Form 4868 for details.

If you, your spouse with whom you are 
filing a joint return, or a dependent was 
enrolled in coverage through the Mar-
ketplace for 2023 and advance payments 
of the premium tax credit were made for 
this coverage, you must file a 2023 re-

mine if you are a resident alien, 
nonresident alien, or dual-sta-
tus alien. Most nonresident aliens and 
dual-status aliens have different filing 
requirements and may have to file Form 
1040-NR. Pub. 519 discusses these re-
quirements and other information to 
help aliens comply with U.S. tax law.

An automatic 6-month exten-
sion to file doesn't extend the 
time to pay your tax. If you 
don’t pay your tax by the original due 
date of your return, you will owe interest 
on the unpaid tax and may owe penal-
ties. See Form 4868.

**Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that isn't exempt from 
tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you can 
exclude part or all of it). Don’t include any social security benefits unless (a) you are married filing a separate return and 
you lived with your spouse at any time in 2023, or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other gross

instructions for lines 6a and 6b to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross income. 
Gross income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a business means, 
for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in figuring gross income, don’t reduce your 
income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9.
***If you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2023 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at 
least $5, you must file a return regardless of your age.

Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code.


Foreign Address

All payers of income, including fi-
nancial institutions, should be promptly 
notified of the taxpayer's death. This 
will ensure the proper reporting of in-
come earned by the taxpayer's estate or 
heirs. A deceased taxpayer's social se-
curity number shouldn't be used for tax 
years after the year of death, except for 
estate tax return purposes.

Name and Address

If you have a foreign address, enter the 
city name on the appropriate line. Don’t 
enter any other information on that line, 
but also complete the spaces below that 
line. Don’t abbreviate the country name. 
Follow the country’s practice for enter-
ing the postal code and the name of the 
province, county, or state.

Print or type the information in the 
spaces provided. If you are married fil-
ing a separate return, enter your spouse's 
name in the entry space below the filing 
status checkboxes instead of below your 
name.

Death of a Taxpayer

If you filed a joint return for 
2022 and you are filing a joint 
return for 2023 with the same 
spouse, be sure to enter your names and 
SSNs in the same order as on your 2022 
return.

Social Security 
Number (SSN)

TIP

If a taxpayer died before filing a return 
for 2023, the taxpayer's spouse or per-
sonal representative may have to file and 
sign a return for that taxpayer. A person-
al representative can be an executor, ad-
ministrator, or anyone who is in charge 
of the deceased taxpayer's property. If 
the deceased taxpayer didn't have to file 
a return but had tax withheld, a return 
must be filed to get a refund. The person 
who files the return must enter “De-
ceased,” the deceased taxpayer's name, 
and the date of death across the top of 
the return. If this information isn't provi-
ded, it may delay the processing of the 
return.

An incorrect or missing SSN can in-
crease your tax, reduce your refund, or 
delay your refund. To apply for an SSN, 
fill in Form SS-5 and return it, along 
with the appropriate evidence docu-
ments, to the Social Security Adminis-
tration (SSA). You can get Form SS-5 
online at SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf, from 
your local SSA office, or by calling the 
SSA at 800-772-1213. It usually takes 
about 2 weeks to get an SSN once the 
SSA has all the evidence and informa-
tion it needs.

Name Change

If you changed your name because of 
marriage, divorce, etc., be sure to report 
the change to the Social Security Ad-
ministration (SSA) before filing your re-
turn. This prevents delays in processing 
your return and issuing refunds. It also 
safeguards your future social security 
benefits.

Address Change

If you plan to move after filing your re-
turn, use Form 8822 to notify the IRS of 
your new address.

If your spouse died in 2023 and you 
didn't remarry in 2023, or if your spouse 
died in 2024 before filing a return for 
2023, you can file a joint return. A joint 
return should show your spouse's 2023 
income before death and your income 
for all of 2023. Enter “Filing as surviv-
ing spouse” in the area where you sign 
the return. If someone else is the person-
al representative, they must also sign.

Check that both the name and SSN 
on your Forms 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2, 
and 1099 agree with your social security 
card. If they don’t, certain deductions 
and credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR 
may be reduced or disallowed and you 
may not receive credit for your social 
security earnings. If your Form W-2 
shows an incorrect SSN or name, notify 
your employer or the form-issuing agent 

P.O. Box

Enter your box number only if your post 
office doesn't deliver mail to your home.

as soon as possible to make sure your 
earnings are credited to your social se-
curity record. If the name or SSN on 
your social security card is incorrect, 
call the SSA.

Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS 
office or write a letter to the IRS ex-
plaining that you now have an SSN and 
want all your tax records combined un-
der your SSN. Details about what to in-
clude with the letter and where to mail it 
are at IRS.gov/ITIN.

at the end of 2023, your divorce wasn't 
final (an interlocutory decree), you are 
considered married and can't check the 
box.

• You were widowed before January 
1, 2023, and didn't remarry before the 
end of 2023. But if you have a child, 
you may be able to use the qualifying 
surviving spouse filing status. See the 
instructions for Qualifying Surviving 
Spouse, later.

Once you are issued an SSN, use it to 
file your tax return. Use your SSN to file 
your tax return even if your SSN does 
not authorize employment or if you have 
been issued an SSN that authorizes em-
ployment and you lose your employ-
ment authorization. An ITIN will not be 
issued to you once you have been issued 
an SSN. If you received your SSN after 
previously using an ITIN, stop using 
your ITIN. Use your SSN instead.

Nonresident Alien Spouse

If your spouse is a nonresident alien, 
your spouse must have either an SSN or 
an ITIN if:

Married Filing Jointly

• You file a joint return, or
• Your spouse is filing a separate re-
turn.

You can check the “Married filing joint-
ly” box at the top of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR if any of the following apply.

Presidential Election 
Campaign Fund

• You were married at the end of 
2023, even if you didn't live with your 
spouse at the end of 2023.

IRS Individual Taxpayer 
Identification Numbers 
(ITINs) for Aliens

This fund helps pay for Presidential 
election campaigns. The fund reduces 
candidates' dependence on large contri-
butions from individuals and groups and 
places candidates on an equal financial 
footing in the general election. The fund 
also helps pay for pediatric medical re-
search. If you want $3 to go to this fund, 
check the box. If you are filing a joint 
return, your spouse can also have $3 go 
to the fund. If you check a box, your tax 
or refund won't change.

• Your spouse died in 2023 and you 
didn't remarry in 2023.

• You were married at the end of 
2023 and your spouse died in 2024 be-
fore filing a 2023 return.

If you are a nonresident or resident alien 
and you don’t have and aren’t eligible to 
get an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. 
It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN.

A married couple filing jointly report 
their combined income and deduct their 
combined allowable expenses on one re-
turn. They can file a joint return even if 
only one had income or if they didn't 
live together all year. However, both 
persons must sign the return. Once you 
file a joint return, you can't choose to 
file separate returns for that year after 
the due date of the return.
Joint and several tax liability. If you 
file a joint return, both you and your 
spouse are generally responsible for the 
tax and interest or penalties due on the 
return. This means that if one spouse 
doesn't pay the tax due, the other may 
have to. Or, if one spouse doesn't report 
the correct tax, both spouses may be re-
sponsible for any additional taxes as-
sessed by the IRS. You may want to file 
separately if:

If you already have an ITIN, enter it 
wherever your SSN is requested on your 
tax return.

Some ITINs must be renewed. If you 
haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax 
return at least once for tax years 2020, 
2021, or 2022, it has expired and must 
be renewed if you need to file a federal 
tax return. You don't need to renew your 
ITIN if you don't need to file a federal 
tax return. You can find more informa-
tion at IRS.gov/ITIN.

Filing Status

Check only the filing status that applies 
to you. The ones that will usually give 
you the lowest tax are listed last.

• Married filing separately.
• Single.
• Head of household.
• Married filing jointly.
• Qualifying surviving spouse.

ITINs assigned before 2013 
have expired and must be re-
newed if you need to file a tax 
return. If you previously submitted a re-
newal application and it was approved, 
you do not need to renew again unless 
you haven't used your ITIN on a federal 
tax return at least once for tax years 
2020, 2021, or 2022.

TIP


For information about marital status, see 
Pub. 501.

More than one filing status can 
apply to you. You can choose 
the one for which you qualify 
that will give you the lowest tax.

An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't 
entitle you to social security benefits or 
change your employment or immigra-
tion status under U.S. law.

Single

You can check the “Single” box at the 
top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any of 
the following was true on December 31, 
2023.

rents under Who Qualifies as Your De-
pendent, later.

• You were legally separated accord-
ing to your state law under a decree of 
divorce or separate maintenance at the 
end of 2023. But if, at the end of 2023, 
your divorce wasn't final (an interlocuto-
ry decree), you are considered married.

Married Filing Separately

Check the “Married filing separately” 
box at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR 
if you are married, at the end of 2023, 
and file a separate return. Enter your 
spouse’s name in the entry space below 
the filing status checkboxes. Be sure to 
enter your spouse’s SSN or Individual 
Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) 
in the space for spouse’s SSN on Form 
1040 or 1040-SR. If your spouse doesn’t 
have and isn’t required to have an SSN 
or ITIN, enter “NRA” in the entry space 
below the filing status checkboxes.

If the child isn't claimed as your de-
pendent, enter the child's name in the en-
try space below the filing status check-
boxes. If you don’t enter the name, it 
will take us longer to process your re-
turn.

• You are married but lived apart 
from your spouse for the last 6 months 
of 2023 and you meet the other rules un-
der Married persons who live apart, lat-
er.

• You are married and your spouse 
was a nonresident alien at any time dur-
ing the year and the election to treat the 
alien spouse as a resident alien is not 
made.
Check the “Head of household” box on-
ly if you are unmarried (or considered 
unmarried) and either Test 1 or Test 2 
applies.
Test 1. You paid over half the cost of 
keeping up a home that was the main 
home for all of 2023 of your parent 
whom you can claim as a dependent, ex-
cept under a multiple support agreement 
(see Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, 
later). Your parent didn't have to live 
with you.
Test 2. You paid over half the cost of 
keeping up a home in which you lived 
and in which one of the following also 
lived for more than half of the year (if 
half or less, see Exception to time lived 
with you, later).

try space below the filing status check-
boxes.

The dependents you claim are 
those you list by name and SSN 
in the Dependents section on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

TIP


If you are married and file a separate 
return, you generally report only your 
own income, deductions, and credits. 
Generally, you are responsible only for 
the tax on your own income. Different 
rules apply to people in community 
property states; see Pub. 555.

Exception to time lived with you. 
Temporary absences by you or the other 
person for special circumstances, such 
as school, vacation, business, medical 
care, military service, or detention in a 
juvenile facility, count as time lived in 
the home. Also see Kidnapped child, lat-
er, under Who Qualifies as Your De-
pendent, if applicable.

However, you will usually pay more 
tax than if you use another filing status 
for which you qualify. Also, if you file a 
separate return, you can't take the stu-
dent loan interest deduction or the edu-
cation credits, and you will only be able 
to take the earned income credit and 
child and dependent care credit in very 
limited circumstances. You also can't 
take the standard deduction if your 
spouse itemizes deductions. For situa-
tions when you might want to file sepa-
rately, see Joint and several tax liability, 
earlier.

If the person for whom you kept up a 
home was born or died in 2023, you still 
may be able to file as head of household. 
If the person is your qualifying child, the 
child must have lived with you for more 
than half the part of the year the child 
was alive. If the person is anyone else, 
see Pub. 501. Similarly, if you adopted 
the person for whom you kept up a 
home in 2023, the person was lawfully 
placed with you for legal adoption by 
you in 2023, or the person was an eligi-
ble foster child placed with you during 
2023, the person is considered to have 
lived with you for more than half of 
2023 if your main home was this per-
son’s main home for more than half the 
time since the person was adopted or 
placed with you in 2023.
Keeping up a home. To find out what 
is included in the cost of keeping up a 
home, see Pub. 501.

1. Any person whom you can claim 
as a dependent. But don’t include:

a.
Your child whom you claim as 
your dependent because of the rule for 
Children of divorced or separated pa-
rents under Who Qualifies as Your De-
pendent, later;

b. Any person who is your depend-
ent only because the person lived with 
you for all of 2023; or

Digital Assets

If the child isn’t claimed as your de-
pendent, enter the child’s name in the 
entry space below the filing status 
checkboxes. If you don’t enter the name, 
it will take us longer to process your re-
turn.

Married persons who live apart. Even 
if you weren’t divorced or legally sepa-
rated at the end of 2023, you are consid-
ered unmarried if all of the following 
apply.

Digital assets are any digital representa-
tions of value that are recorded on a 
cryptographically secured distributed 
ledger or any similar technology. For ex-
ample, digital assets include non-fungi-
ble tokens (NFTs) and virtual currencies, 
such as cryptocurrencies and stable-
coins. If a particular asset has the char-
acteristics of a digital asset, it will be 
treated as a digital asset for federal in-
come tax purposes.

• You lived apart from your spouse 
for the last 6 months of 2023. Tempora-
ry absences for special circumstances, 
such as for business, medical care, 
school, or military service, count as time 
lived in the home.

3. This child lived in your home for 
all of 2023. If the child didn't live with 
you for the required time, see Exception 
to time lived with you, later.

4. You paid over half the cost of 
keeping up your home.

• You file a separate return from 
your spouse.

5. You could have filed a joint re-
turn with your spouse the year your 
spouse died, even if you didn't actually 
do so.

Check the “Yes” box next to the 
question on digital assets on page 1 of 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR if at any time 
during 2023, you (a) received (as a re-
ward, award, or payment for property or 
services); or (b) sold, exchanged, or oth-
erwise disposed of a digital asset (or any 
financial interest in any digital asset).

• You paid over half the cost of 
keeping up your home for 2023.

• Your home was the main home of 
your child, stepchild, or foster child for 
more than half of 2023 (if half or less, 
see Exception to time lived with you, 
earlier).

If your spouse died in 2023, you can't 
file as qualifying surviving spouse. In-
stead, see the instructions for Married 
Filing Jointly, earlier.
Adopted child. An adopted child is al-
ways treated as your own child. An 
adopted child includes a child lawfully 
placed with you for legal adoption.
Dependent. To find out if someone is 
your dependent, see Who Qualifies as 
Your Dependent, later.

• You can claim this child as your 
dependent or could claim the child ex-
cept that the child's other parent can 
claim the child under the rule for Chil-
dren of divorced or separated parents 
under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, 
later.

For example, check “Yes” if at any 
time during 2023 you:

• Received digital assets as payment 
for property or services provided;

• Received digital assets as a result 
of a reward or award;

• Received new digital assets as a 
result of mining, staking, and similar ac-
tivities;

Adopted child. An adopted child is 
always treated as your own child. An 
adopted child includes a child lawfully 
placed with you for legal adoption.

The dependents you claim are 
those you list by name and SSN 
in the Dependents section on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

TIP

• Received digital assets as a result 
of a hard fork;

• Disposed of digital assets in ex-
change for property or services;

Foster child. A foster child is any 
child placed with you by an authorized 
placement agency or by judgment, de-
cree, or other order of any court of com-
petent jurisdiction.

Exception to time lived with you. 
Temporary absences by you or the child 
for special circumstances, such as 
school, vacation, business, medical care, 
military service, or detention in a juve-
nile facility, count as time lived in the 
home. Also see Kidnapped child, later, 
under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, 
if applicable.

• Disposed of a digital asset in ex-
change or trade for another digital asset;

• Sold a digital asset; or
• Otherwise disposed of any other fi-
nancial interest in a digital asset.

Qualifying Surviving 
Spouse

You have a financial interest in a dig-
ital asset if you are the owner of record 
of a digital asset, or have an ownership 
stake in an account that holds one or 
more digital assets, including the rights 
and obligations to acquire a financial in-
terest, or you own a wallet that holds 
digital assets.

You can check the “Qualifying surviving 
spouse” box at the top of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR and use joint return tax rates 
for 2023 if all of the following apply.

A child is considered to have lived 
with you for all of 2023 if the child was 
born or died in 2023 and your home was 
the child's home for the entire time the 
child was alive. Similarly, if you adop-
ted the child in 2023, or the child was 
lawfully placed with you for legal adop-
tion by you in 2023, the child is consid-
ered to have lived with you for all of 
2023 if your main home was this child's 
main home for the entire time since the 
child was adopted or placed with you in 
2023.
Keeping up a home. To find out what 
is included in the cost of keeping up a

use Form 8949 to calculate your capital 
gain or loss and report that gain or loss 
on Schedule D (Form 1040).

If your eye condition isn't likely to 
improve beyond the conditions listed 
above, you can get a statement certified 
by your eye doctor (ophthalmologist or 
optometrist) to this effect instead.

You must keep the statement for your 
records.

If you received any digital asset as 
compensation for services or disposed of 
any digital asset that you held for sale to 
customers in a trade or business, you 
must report the income as you would re-
port other income of the same type (for 
example, W-2 wages on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, line 1a, or inventory or serv-
ices on Schedule C).

Age/Blindness

If you receive a notice or letter but 
you would prefer to have it in Braille or 
large print, you can use Form 9000, Al-
ternative Media Preference, to request 
notices in an alternative format includ-
ing Braille, large print, audio, or elec-
tronic. You can attach Form 9000 to 
your return or mail it separately.

If you or your spouse (if you are married 
and filing a joint return) were born be-
fore January 2, 1959, or were blind at 
the end of 2023, check the appropriate 
boxes on the line labeled “Age/Blind-
ness.”

Don’t check any boxes for your 
spouse if your filing status is head of 
household.
Death of spouse in 2023. If your 
spouse was born before January 2, 1959, 
but died in 2023 before reaching age 65, 
don’t check the box that says “Spouse 
was born before January 2, 1959.”

If you disposed of any digital asset by 
gift, you may be required to file Form 
709. See Who Must File and Transfers 
Subject to the Gift Tax in the Instructions 
for Form 709 for more information.

• You can download, or view online, 
tax forms and publications in a variety 
of formats including text-only, Braille 
ready files, browser-friendly HTML 
(other than tax forms), accessible PDF, 
and large print.

Married Filing Separately

Standard Deduction

If your filing status is married filing sep-
arately and your spouse itemizes deduc-
tions on their return, check the “Spouse 
itemizes on a separate return or you 
were a dual-status alien” box.

A person is considered to reach age 
65 on the day before the person’s 65th 
birthday.

If you are filing Form 1040-SR, 
you can find a Standard Deduc-
tion Chart on the last page of 
that form that can calculate the amount 
of your standard deduction in most sit-
uations.

TIP

Example. Your spouse was born on 
February 14, 1958, and died on February 
13, 2023. Your spouse is considered age 
65 at the time of death. Check the appro-
priate box for your spouse. However, if 
your spouse died on February 12, 2023, 
your spouse isn't considered age 65. 
Don’t check the box.
Death of taxpayer in 2023. If you are 
preparing a return for someone who died 
in 2023, see Pub. 501 before completing 
the standard deduction information.

If your filing status is married filing 
separately and your spouse was born be-
fore January 2, 1959, or was blind at the 
end of 2023, you can check the appro-
priate box(es) on the line labeled “Age/
Blindness” if your spouse had no in-
come, isn't filing a return, and can't be 
claimed as a dependent on another per-
son's return.

Don’t file the Standard Deduction 
Chart with your return.

income. See Pub. 501 for an exception for a parent who works 
at night, rules for a child who is emancipated under state law, 
and other details.

Definitions and Special Rules

Adopted child. An adopted child is always treated as your own 
child. An adopted child includes a child lawfully placed with 
you for legal adoption.

Post-1984 and pre-2009 decree or agreement. The decree 
or agreement must state all three of the following.

1. The noncustodial parent can claim the child as a depend-
ent without regard to any condition, such as payment of support.

Adoption taxpayer identification numbers (ATINs). If you 
have a dependent who was placed with you for legal adoption 
and you don’t know the dependent’s SSN, you must get an 
ATIN for the dependent from the IRS. See Form W-7A for de-
tails. If the dependent isn't a U.S. citizen or resident alien, apply 
for an ITIN instead using Form W-7.

2. The other parent won't claim the child as a dependent.
3. The years for which the claim is released.

The noncustodial parent must include all of the following pa-
ges from the decree or agreement.

• Cover page (include the other parent's SSN on that page).
• The pages that include all the information identified in (1) 
through (3) above.

Children of divorced or separated parents. A child will be 
treated as the qualifying child or qualifying relative of the 
child’s noncustodial parent (defined later) if all of the following 
conditions apply.

• Signature page with the other parent's signature and date 
of agreement.

1. The parents are divorced, legally separated, separated un-
der a written separation agreement, or lived apart at all times 
during the last 6 months of 2023 (whether or not they are or 
were married).

You must include the required information even if you 
filed it with your return in an earlier year.

CAUTION
!

2. The child received over half of the child’s support for 
2023 from the parents (and the rules on Multiple support agree-
ments, later, don’t apply). Support of a child received from a pa-
rent's spouse is treated as provided by the parent.

Post-2008 decree or agreement. If the divorce decree or 
separation agreement went into effect after 2008, the noncusto-
dial parent can't include pages from the decree or agreement in-
stead of Form 8332. The custodial parent must sign either Form 
8332 or a substantially similar statement the only purpose of 
which is to release the custodial parent's claim to certain tax 
benefits for a child, and the noncustodial parent must include a 
copy with their return. The form or statement must release the 
custodial parent's claim to the child without any conditions. For 
example, the release must not depend on the noncustodial pa-
rent paying support.

3. The child is in custody of one or both of the parents for 
more than half of 2023.

4. Either of the following applies.
a.
The custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially 
similar statement that they won't claim the child as a dependent 
for 2023, and the noncustodial parent includes a copy of the 
form or statement with their return. If the divorce decree or sep-
aration agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, 
the noncustodial parent may be able to include certain pages 
from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. See 
Post-1984 and pre-2009 decree or agreement and Post-2008 de-
cree or agreement.

Release of certain tax benefits revoked. A custodial parent 
who has revoked their previous release of a claim to certain tax 
benefits for a child must include a copy of the revocation with 
their return. For details, see Form 8332.

Exception to citizen test. If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. na-
tional and your adopted child lived with you all year as a mem-
ber of your household, that child meets the requirement to be a 
U.S. citizen in Step 2, question 1; Step 3, question 2; Step 4, 
question 2; and Step 5, question 2.
Exception to gross income test. If your relative (including a 
person who lived with you all year as a member of your house-
hold) is permanently and totally disabled (defined later), certain 
income for services performed at a sheltered workshop may be 
excluded for this test. For details, see Pub. 501.
Exception to time lived with you. Temporary absences by you 
or the other person for special circumstances, such as school, 
vacation, business, medical care, military service, or detention 
in a juvenile facility, count as time the person lived with you. 
Also see Children of divorced or separated parents, earlier, or 
Kidnapped child, later.

b. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or 
written separation agreement between the parents provides that 
the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, and 
the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for support of the 
child during 2023.

If conditions (1) through (4) apply, only the noncustodial pa-
rent can claim the child for purposes of the child tax credits and 
credit for other dependents (lines 19 and 28). However, this 
doesn't allow the noncustodial parent to claim head of house-
hold filing status, the credit for child and dependent care expen-
ses, the exclusion for dependent care benefits, or the earned in-
come credit. The custodial parent or another taxpayer, if eligi-
ble, can claim the child for the earned income credit and these 
other benefits. See Pub. 501 for details.

Custodial and noncustodial parents. The custodial parent is 
the parent with whom the child lived for the greater number of 
nights in 2023. The noncustodial parent is the other parent. If 
the child was with each parent for an equal number of nights, 
the custodial parent is the parent with the higher adjusted gross 

If the person meets all other requirements to be your qualify-
ing child but was born or died in 2023, the person is considered

was alive in 2023. If the person meets all other requirements to 
be your qualifying child but you adopted the person in 2023, the 
person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you 
in 2023, or the person was an eligible foster child placed with 
you during 2023, the person is considered to have lived with 
you for more than half of 2023 if your main home was this per-
son's main home for more than half the time since the person 
was adopted or placed with you in 2023.

Children of divorced or separated parents, described earlier, ap-
plies.

1. Child tax credit and credit for other dependents (line 19) 
and additional child tax credit (line 28).

2. Head of household filing status.
3. Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule 
3, line 2).

4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part 
III).

Any other person is considered to have lived with you for all 
of 2023 if the person was born or died in 2023 and your home 
was this person's home for the entire time the person was alive 
in 2023 or if you adopted the person in 2023, the person was 
lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2023, or 
the person was an eligible foster child placed with you during 
2023 and your main home was the person's main home for the 
entire time since the person was adopted or placed with you in 
2023.

5. Earned income credit (line 27).

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed 
based on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can 
claim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. 
For purposes of these rules, the term "parent" means a biologi-
cal or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a step-
parent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the indi-
vidual.

Foster child. A foster child is any child placed with you by an 
authorized placement agency or by judgment, decree, or other 
order of any court of competent jurisdiction.

• If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is 
treated as the qualifying child of the parent.

• If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the 
child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying 
child of the parents.

Kidnapped child. If your child is presumed by law enforce-
ment authorities to have been kidnapped by someone who isn't a 
family member, you may be able to take the child into account 
in determining your eligibility for head of household or qualify-
ing surviving spouse filing status, the child tax credit, the credit 
for other dependents, and the earned income credit (EIC). For 
details, see Pub. 501 (Pub. 596 for the EIC).

• If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both pa-
rents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the 
child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child 
lived for the longer period of time in 2023. If the child lived 
with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat 
the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the high-
er adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2023.

Married person. If the person is married and files a joint re-
turn, you can't claim that person as your dependent. However, if 
the person is married but doesn't file a joint return or files a 
joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or es-
timated tax paid, you may be able to claim that person as a de-
pendent. (See Pub. 501 for details and examples.) In that case, 
go to Step 2, question 3 (for a qualifying child), or Step 4, ques-
tion 4 (for a qualifying relative).

• If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the 
child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the 
highest AGI for 2023.

• If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no 
parent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualify-
ing child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2023, but 
only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any 
parent of the child who can claim the child.

Multiple support agreements. If no one person contributed 
over half of the support of your relative (or a person who lived 
with you all year as a member of your household) but you and 
another person(s) provided more than half of your relative's 
support, special rules may apply that would treat you as having 
provided over half of the support. For details, see Pub. 501.

Example. Your child, J, meets the conditions to be a qualify-
ing child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the condi-
tions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J’s 
other parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a 
qualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for 
which you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of 
those five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent’s 
AGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying 
child, J is the qualifying child of your parent.

Permanently and totally disabled. A person is permanently 
and totally disabled if, at any time in 2023, the person can't en-
gage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or 
mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condition 
has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least a 
year or can be expected to lead to death.
Public assistance payments. If you received payments under 
the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program 
or other public assistance program and you used the money to 
support another person, see Pub. 501.

For more details and examples, see Pub. 501.
If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to 
Step 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on 
this child.


Social security number. You must enter each dependent's so-
cial security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered 
agree with the dependent's social security card. Otherwise, at 
the time we process your return, we may reduce or disallow any 
tax benefits (such as the child tax credit) based on that 

Qualifying child of more than one person. Even if a child 
meets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one 
person, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child 
for all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for

dependent. If the name or SSN on the dependent's social securi-
ty card isn't correct or you need to get an SSN for your depend-
ent, contact the Social Security Administration (SSA). See So-
cial Security Number (SSN), earlier. If your dependent won't 
have a number by the date your return is due, see What if You 
Can't File on Time? earlier.

the Dependents section and include a copy of the child's birth 
certificate, death certificate, or hospital records. The document 
must show the child was born alive.

If you, or your spouse if filing jointly, didn't have an SSN (or 
ITIN) issued on or before the due date of your 2023 return (in-
cluding extensions), you can't claim the child tax credit or the 
credit for other dependents on your original or an amended 
2023 return.

For the child tax credit, your child must have the required 
SSN. The required SSN is one that is valid for employment and 
that is issued by the SSA before the due date of your 2023 re-
turn (including extensions). If your child was a U.S. citizen 
when the child received the SSN, the SSN is valid for employ-
ment. If “Not Valid for Employment” is printed on your child’s 
social security card and your child’s immigration status has 
changed so that your child is now a U.S. citizen or permanent 
resident, ask the SSA for a new social security card without the 
legend. However, if “Valid for Work Only With DHS Authori-
zation” is printed on your child’s social security card, your child 
has the required SSN only as long as the DHS authorization is 
valid.

If you apply for an ITIN on or before the due date of your 
2023 return (including extensions) and the IRS issues you an 
ITIN as a result of the application, the IRS will consider your 
ITIN as issued on or before the due date of your return.
Student. A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar 
months of 2023 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school 
or took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or 
a state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a 
technical, trade, or mechanical school. It doesn't include an 
on-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school of-
fering courses only through the Internet.

If your dependent child was born and died in 2023 and you 
do not have an SSN for the child, enter “Died” in column (2) of

Form 8958 and Pub. 555.
Nevada, Washington, and California 
domestic partners. A registered do-
mestic partner in Nevada, Washington, 
or California must generally report half 
the combined community income of the 
individual and their domestic partner. 
See Form 8958 and Pub. 555.

Foreign financial assets. If you had 
foreign financial assets in 2023, you 
may have to file Form 8938. See Form 
8938 and its instructions.

Income

Generally, you must report all income 
except income that is exempt from tax 
by law. For details, see the following in-
structions and the Schedule 1 instruc-
tions, especially the instructions for lines 
1 through 7 and Schedule 1, lines 1 
through 8z. Also see Pub. 525.

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy 
Cases

If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy case, income taxable to the bank-
ruptcy estate and reported on the estate's 
income tax return includes:

Rounding Off to Whole 
Dollars

Forgiveness of Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP) 
Loans

• Earnings from services you per-
formed after the beginning of the case 
(both wages and self-employment in-
come); and

You can round off cents to whole dollars 
on your return and schedules. If you do 
round to whole dollars, you must round 
all amounts. To round, drop amounts un-
der 50 cents and increase amounts from 
50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For ex-
ample, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 be-
comes $3.

You don’t need to include the amount of 
a forgiven PPP Loan in your income. 
Although you don’t need to report the 
income from the forgiveness of your 
PPP Loan on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, 
you do need to report certain informa-
tion related to your PPP Loan as an at-
tachment to your tax return. For more 
information, see Pub. 525.

• Income from property described in 
section 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code 
that you either owned when the case be-
gan or that you acquired after the case 
began and before the case was closed, 
dismissed, or converted to a case under a 
different chapter.

If you have to add two or more 
amounts to figure the amount to enter on 
a line, include cents when adding the 
amounts and round off only the total.

Because this income is taxable to the 
estate, don’t include this income on your 
own individual income tax return. The 
only exception is for purposes of figur-
ing your self-employment tax. For that 
purpose, you must take into account all 
your self-employment income for the 
year from services performed both be-
fore and after the beginning of the case. 
Also, you (or the trustee if one is ap-
pointed) must allocate between you and 
the bankruptcy estate the wages, salary, 
or other compensation and withheld in-
come tax reported to you on Form W-2. 
A similar allocation is required for in-
come and withheld income tax reported 
to you on Forms 1099. You must also in-
clude a statement that indicates you filed 
a chapter 11 case and that explains how 
income and withheld income tax repor-
ted to you on Forms W-2 and 1099 are 
allocated between you and the estate. 
For more details, including acceptable 
allocation methods, see Notice 2006-83, 
2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at
IRS.gov/irb/
2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83.

Foreign-Source Income

If you are entering amounts that in-
clude cents, make sure to include the 
decimal point. There is no cents column 
on the form.

You must report unearned income, such 
as interest, dividends, and pensions, 
from sources outside the United States 
unless exempt by law or a tax treaty. 
You must also report earned income, 
such as wages and tips, from sources 
outside the United States.

The lines on Forms 1040 and 
1040-SR are the same. Referen-
ces to lines in the following in-
structions refer to the line on either 
form.

CAUTION
!

If you worked abroad, you may be 
able to exclude part or all of your for-
eign earned income. For details, see 
Pub. 54 and Form 2555.
Foreign retirement plans. If you were 
a beneficiary of a foreign retirement 
plan, you may have to report the undis-
tributed income earned in your plan. 
However, if you were the beneficiary of 
a Canadian registered retirement plan, 
see Rev. Proc. 2014-55, 2014-44 I.R.B.

• Strike or lockout benefits (other 
than bona fide gifts).

• Excess elective deferrals. The 
amount deferred should be shown in 
box 12 of your Form W-2, and the “Re-
tirement plan” box in box 13 should be 
checked. If the total amount you (or 
your spouse if filing jointly) deferred for 
2023 under all plans was more than 
$22,500 (excluding catch-up contribu-
tions as explained later), include the ex-
cess on line 1h. This limit is (a) $15,500 
if you have only SIMPLE plans, or (b) 
$25,500 for section 403(b) plans if you 
qualify for the 15-year rule in Pub. 571. 
Although designated Roth contributions 
are subject to this limit, don’t include 
the excess attributable to such contribu-
tions on line 1h. They are already inclu-
ded as income in box 1 of your Form 
W-2.

Line 1e

Enter the total of your wages received as 
a household employee that was not re-
ported on Form(s) W-2. An employer

didn’t report to your employer and any 
allocated tips shown in box 8 on your 
Form(s) W-2 unless you can prove that 
your unreported tips are less than the 
amount in box 8. Allocated tips aren't in-
cluded as income in box 1. See Pub. 531 
for more details. Also include the value 
of any noncash tips you received, such 
as tickets, passes, or other items of val-
ue. Although you don’t report these non-

the Instructions for Form 8839 to find 
out if you can exclude part or all of the 
benefits. You may also be able to ex-
clude amounts if you adopted a child 
with special needs and the adoption be-
came final in 2023.

If you were age 50 or older at the end 
of 2023, your employer may have al-
lowed an additional deferral (catch-up 
contributions) of up to $7,500 ($3,500 
for section 401(k)(11) and SIMPLE 
plans). This additional deferral amount 
isn't subject to the overall limit on elec-
tive deferrals.

You may owe social security 
and Medicare or railroad re-
tirement (RRTA) tax on unre-
ported tips. See the instructions for 
Schedule 2, line 5.

Tax-Exempt Interest

Interest credited in 2023 on deposits 
that you couldn't withdraw because of 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of the fi-
nancial institution may not have to be 
included in your 2023 income. For de-
tails, see Pub. 550.

If you received any tax-exempt interest 
(including any tax-exempt original issue 
discount (OID)), such as from municipal 
bonds, each payer should send you a 
Form 1099-INT or a Form 1099-OID. In 
general, your tax-exempt stated interest 
should be shown in box 8 of Form 
1099-INT or, for a tax-exempt OID 
bond, in box 2 of Form 1099-OID, and 
your tax-exempt OID should be shown 
in box 11 of Form 1099-OID. Enter the 
total on line 2a. However, if you ac-
quired a tax-exempt bond at a premium, 
only report the net amount of tax-ex-
empt interest on line 2a (that is, the ex-
cess of the tax-exempt interest received 
during the year over the amortized bond 
premium for the year). Also, if you ac-
quired a tax-exempt OID bond at an ac-
quisition premium, only report the net 
amount of tax-exempt OID on line 2a 
(that is, the excess of tax-exempt OID 
for the year over the amortized acquisi-
tion premium for the year). See Pub. 550 
for more information about OID, bond 
premium, and acquisition premium.

• Corrective distributions from a 
retirement plan shown on Form 1099-R 
of excess elective deferrals and excess 
contributions (plus earnings). But don’t 
include distributions from an IRA* on 
line 1h. Instead, report distributions 
from an IRA on lines 4a and 4b.

If you get a 2023 Form 
1099-INT for U.S. savings bond 
interest that includes amounts 
you reported before 2023, see Pub. 550.

Qualified Dividends

Nontaxable Combat Pay 
Election

Enter your total qualified dividends on
line 3a. Qualified dividends are also in-
cluded in the ordinary dividend total re-
quired to be shown on line 3b. Qualified 
dividends are eligible for a lower tax 
rate than other ordinary income. Gener-
ally, these dividends are shown in 
box 1b of Form(s) 1099-DIV. See Pub. 
550 for the definition of qualified divi-
dends if you received dividends not re-
ported on Form 1099-DIV.
Exception. Some dividends may be re-
ported as qualified dividends in box 1b 
of Form 1099-DIV but aren't qualified 
dividends. These include:

If you elect to include your nontaxable 
combat pay in your earned income when 
figuring the EIC, enter the amount on 
line 1i. See the instructions for line 27.

Were You a Statutory 
Employee?
If you were a statutory employee, the 
“Statutory employee” box in box 13 of 
your Form W-2 should be checked. Stat-
utory employees include full-time life 
insurance salespeople and certain agent 
or commission drivers, certain traveling 
salespeople, and certain homeworkers. 
Statutory employees report the amount 
shown in box 1 of Form W-2 on a 
Schedule C along with any related busi-
ness expenses.

Also include on line 2a any ex-
empt-interest dividends from a mutual 
fund or other regulated investment com-
pany. This amount should be shown in 
box 12 of Form 1099-DIV.

• Dividends you received as a nomi-
nee. See the Schedule B instructions.

• Dividends you received on any 
share of stock that you held for less than 
61 days during the 121-day period that 
began 60 days before the ex-dividend 
date. The ex-dividend date is the first 
date following the declaration of a divi-
dend on which the purchaser of a stock 
isn't entitled to receive the next dividend 
payment. When counting the number of 
days you held the stock, include the day 
you disposed of the stock but not the day 
you acquired it. See the examples that 
follow. Also, when counting the number 
of days you held the stock, you can't 
count certain days during which your 
risk of loss was diminished. See Pub. 
550 for more details.

Don’t include interest earned on your 
IRA, health savings account, Archer or 
Medicare Advantage MSA, or Coverdell 
education savings account.

Don’t include any amounts re-
lated to the forgiveness of PPP 
Loans on this line.

CAUTION
!

Missing or Incorrect 
Form W-2?
Your employer is required to provide or 
send Form W-2 to you no later than
January 31, 2024. If you don’t receive it 
by early February, use Tax Topic 154 to 
find out what to do. Even if you don’t 
get a Form W-2, you must still report 
your earnings. If you lose your Form 
W-2 or it is incorrect, ask your employer 
for a new one.

Line 2b

Taxable Interest

Each payer should send you a Form 
1099-INT or Form 1099-OID. Enter 
your total taxable interest income on 
line 2b. But you must fill in and attach

the extent that you are under an obliga-
tion (including a short sale) to make re-
lated payments with respect to positions 
in substantially similar or related proper-
ty.

Use the Qualified Dividends 
and Capital Gain Tax Work-
sheet or the Schedule D Tax 
Worksheet, whichever applies, to figure 
your tax. See the instructions for line 16

For purposes of these Excep-
tions, Roth IRA includes Roth 
SEP IRA and Roth SIMPLE 
IRAs.

TIP

TIP

• Payments in lieu of dividends, but 
only if you know or have reason to 
know that the payments aren't qualified 
dividends.

Exception 1. Enter the total distribution 
on line 4a if you rolled over part or all of 
the distribution from one:

• Dividends from a corporation that 
first became a surrogate foreign corpora-
tion after December 22, 2017, other than 
a foreign corporation that is treated as a 
domestic corporation under section 
7874(b).

Line 3b

• Roth IRA to another Roth IRA, or
• IRA (other than a Roth IRA) to a 
qualified plan or another IRA (other 
than a Roth IRA).

Ordinary Dividends

Each payer should send you a Form 
1099-DIV. Enter your total ordinary div-
idends on line 3b. This amount should 
be shown in box 1a of Form(s) 
1099-DIV.

Also enter “Rollover” next to line 4b. 
If the total distribution was rolled over, 
enter -0- on line 4b. If the total distribu-
tion wasn't rolled over, enter the part not 
rolled over on line 4b unless Exception 2 
applies to the part not rolled over. Gen-
erally, a rollover must be made within 
60 days after the day you received the 
distribution. For more details on roll-
overs, see Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B.

Example 1. You bought 5,000 shares 
of XYZ Corp. common stock on July 8. 
XYZ Corp. paid a cash dividend of 10 
cents per share. The ex-dividend date 
was July 16. Your Form 1099-DIV from 
XYZ Corp. shows $500 in box 1a (ordi-
nary dividends) and in box 1b (qualified 
dividends). However, you sold the 5,000 
shares on August 11. You held your 
shares of XYZ Corp. for only 34 days of 
the 121-day period (from July 9 through 
August 11). The 121-day period began 
on May 17 (60 days before the ex-divi-
dend date) and ended on September 14. 
You have no qualified dividends from 
XYZ Corp. because you held the XYZ 
stock for less than 61 days.

You must fill in and attach Sched-
ule B if the total is over $1,500 or you 
received, as a nominee, ordinary divi-
dends that actually belong to someone 
else.

Nondividend Distributions

If you rolled over the distribution into 
a qualified plan or you made the rollover 
in 2024, include a statement explaining 
what you did.
Exception 2. If any of the following ap-
ply, enter the total distribution on line 4a 
and see Form 8606 and its instructions 
to figure the amount to enter on line 4b.

Some distributions are a return of your 
cost (or other basis). They won't be 
taxed until you recover your cost (or 
other basis). You must reduce your cost 
(or other basis) by these distributions. 
After you get back all of your cost (or 
other basis), you must report these dis-
tributions as capital gains on Form 8949. 
For details, see Pub. 550.

Example 2. The facts are the same as 
in Example 1 except that you bought the 
stock on July 15 (the day before the 
ex-dividend date), and you sold the 
stock on September 16. You held the 
stock for 63 days (from July 16 through 
September 16). The $500 of qualified 
dividends shown in box 1b of Form 
1099-DIV are all qualified dividends be-
cause you held the stock for 61 days of 
the 121-day period (from July 16 
through September 14).

1. You received a distribution from 
an IRA (other than a Roth IRA) and you 
made nondeductible contributions to any 
of your traditional IRAs or traditional 
SEP IRAs for 2023 or an earlier year. If 
you made nondeductible contributions to 
these IRAs for 2023, also see Pub. 
590-A and Pub. 590-B.

Dividends on insurance poli-
cies are a partial return of the 
premiums you paid. Don’t re-
port them as dividends. Include them in 
income on Schedule 1, line 8z, only if 
they exceed the total of all net premiums 
you paid for the contract.

2. You received a distribution from 
a Roth IRA. But if either (a) or (b) be-
low applies, enter -0- on line 4b; you

to your HSA. If eligible, you can gener-
ally elect to exclude an HFD from your 
income once in your lifetime. You can't 
exclude more than the limit on HSA 
contributions or more than the amount 
that would otherwise be included in your 
income. If your IRA includes nondeduc-
tible contributions, the HFD is first con-
sidered to be paid out of otherwise taxa-
ble income. See Pub. 969 for details.

Lines 5a and 5b

5. You made excess contributions to 
your IRA for an earlier year and had 
them returned to you in 2023.

Pensions and Annuities

You should receive a Form 1099-R 
showing the total amount of your pen-
sion and annuity payments before in-
come tax or other deductions were with-
held. This amount should be shown in 
box 1 of Form 1099-R. Pension and an-
nuity payments include distributions 
from 401(k), 403(b), and governmental 
457(b) plans. Rollovers and lump-sum 
distributions are explained later. Don’t 
include the following payments on lines 
5a and 5b. Instead, report them on 
line 1h.

6. You recharacterized part or all of 
a contribution to a Roth IRA as a contri-
bution to another type of IRA, or vice 
versa.

Exception 3. If all or part of the distri-
bution is a qualified charitable distribu-
tion (QCD), enter the total distribution 
on line 4a. If the total amount distributed 
is a QCD, enter -0- on line 4b. If only 
part of the distribution is a QCD, enter 
the part that is not a QCD on line 4b un-
less Exception 2 applies to that part. En-
ter “QCD” next to line 4b.

The amount of an HFD reduces 
the amount you can contribute 
to your HSA for the year. If you 
fail to maintain eligibility for an HSA 
for the 12 months following the month of 
the HFD, you may have to report the 
HFD as income and pay an additional 
tax. See Form 8889, Part III.

CAUTION
!


• Disability pensions received before 
you reach the minimum retirement age 
set by your employer.

A QCD is a distribution made direct-
ly by the trustee of your IRA (other than 
an ongoing SEP or SIMPLE IRA) to an 
organization eligible to receive tax-de-
ductible contributions (with certain ex-
ceptions). You must have been at least 
age 70 1/2 when the distribution was 
made.

More than one exception applies. If 
more than one exception applies, include 
a statement showing the amount of each 
exception, instead of making an entry 
next to line 4b. For example: “Line 4b – 
$1,000 Rollover and $500 HFD.” But 
you don’t need to attach a statement if 
only Exception 2 and one other excep-
tion apply.
More than one distribution. If you (or 
your spouse if filing jointly) received 
more than one distribution, figure the 
taxable amount of each distribution and 
enter the total of the taxable amounts on 
line 4b. Enter the total amount of those 
distributions on line 4a.

• Corrective distributions (including 
any earnings) of excess elective defer-
rals or other excess contributions to re-
tirement plans. The plan must advise 
you of the year(s) the distributions are 
includible in income.

Attach 
Form(s) 
1099-R 
to 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any 
federal income tax was with-
held.

TIP

Generally, your total QCDs for the 
year can't be more than $100,000. This 
includes any amount (up to $50,000) of 
a one-time QCD to a split-interest entity. 
If you file a joint return, the same rules 
apply to your spouse. The amount of the 
QCD is limited to the amount that would 
otherwise be included in your income. If 
your IRA includes nondeductible contri-
butions, the distribution is first consid-
ered to be paid out of otherwise taxable 
income. See Pub. 590-B for details.

Fully Taxable Pensions and 
Annuities

Your payments are fully taxable if (a) 
you didn't contribute to the cost (see 
Cost, later) of your pension or annuity, 
or (b) you got your entire cost back tax 
free before 2023. But see Insurance Pre-
miums for Retired Public Safety Offi-
cers, later. If your pension or annuity is 
fully taxable, enter the total pension or 
annuity 
payments 
(from 
Form(s) 
1099-R, box 1) on line 5b; don’t make 
an entry on line 5a.

You must start receiving at least 
a minimum amount from your 
traditional IRA by April 1 of 
the year following the year you reach 
age 72 (age 73 if you reach age 72 in 
2023). If you don’t receive the minimum 
distribution amount, you may have to 
pay an additional tax on the amount that 
should have been distributed. For de-
tails, including how to figure the mini-
mum required distribution, see Pub. 
590-B.

TIP


You can't claim a charitable 
contribution deduction for any 
QCD not included in your in-
come.

CAUTION
!


Exception 4. If all or part of the distri-
bution is a health savings account (HSA) 
funding distribution (HFD), enter the to-
tal distribution on line 4a. If the total 
amount distributed is an HFD and you

time regardless of whether you had be-
come disabled.

Example. You were a contractor 
who was disabled as a direct result of 
participating in efforts to clean up the 
World Trade Center and you are eligible 
for compensation by the September 11 
Victim Compensation Fund. You began 
receiving a disability pension at age 55 
when you could no longer work due to 
your disability. Under your pension plan 
you are entitled to an early retirement 
benefit of $2,500 a month at age 55. If 
you wait until age 62, the normal retire-
ment age under the plan, you would be 
entitled to a normal retirement benefit of 
$3,000 a month. The pension plan pro-
vides that a participant who retires early 
on account of disability is entitled to re-
ceive the participant's normal retirement 
benefit, which in your case equals 
$3,000 a month. Until you turn age 62, 
you can exclude $500 of your monthly 
retirement benefit from income (the dif-
ference between the early retirement 
benefit and the normal retirement bene-
fit, $3,000 - $2,500) received on account 
of disability. You must report the re-
maining $2,500 of monthly pension ben-
efit as taxable. For each month after you 
turn age 62, you must report the full 
amount of the monthly pension benefit 
($3,000 a month) as taxable.

An eligible retirement plan is a gov-
ernmental plan that is a qualified trust or 
a section 403(a), 403(b), or 457(b) plan.

Partially Taxable Pensions and 
Annuities

Enter the total pension or annuity pay-
ments (from Form 1099-R, box 1) on 
line 5a. If your Form 1099-R doesn't 
show the taxable amount, you must use 
the General Rule explained in Pub. 939 
to figure the taxable part to enter on 
line 5b. But if your annuity starting date 
(defined later) was after July 1, 1986, 
see Simplified Method, later, to find out 
if you must use that method to figure the 
taxable part.

You can exclude from income 
only the smaller of the amount 
of 
the 
premiums 
paid 
or 
$3,000. This is true if the distribution 
was made directly from the plan to the 
provider of the accident or health plan 
or long-term care insurance contract or 
if the distribution was made to you and 
you paid the provider of the accident or 
health plan or long-term care insurance 
contract. If you received a distribution 
from your eligible retirement plan, and 
you used part of that distribution to pay 
premiums for an accident or health plan 
or long-term care insurance contract, 
you can still exclude from income only 
the smaller of the amount of the premi-
ums or $3,000. The rest of the distribu-
tion is taxable to you and must be repor-
ted on line 5b.

CAUTION
!


You can ask the IRS to figure the tax-
able part for you for a $1,000 fee. For 
details, see Pub. 939.

If your Form 1099-R shows a taxable 
amount, you can report that amount on 
line 5b. But you may be able to report a 
lower taxable amount by using the Gen-
eral Rule or the Simplified Method or if 
the exclusion for retired public safety of-
ficers, discussed next, applies.

If you make this election, reduce the 
otherwise taxable amount of your pen-
sion or annuity by the amount excluded. 
The amount shown in box 2a of Form 
1099-R doesn't reflect the exclusion. Re-
port your total distributions on line 5a 
and the taxable amount on line 5b. Enter 
“PSO” next to line 5b.

Insurance Premiums for Retired 
Public Safety Officers

If you are an eligible retired public safe-
ty officer (law enforcement officer, fire-
fighter, chaplain, or member of a rescue 
squad or ambulance crew who is retired 
because of disability or because you 
reached normal retirement age), you can 
elect to exclude from income distribu-
tions made from your eligible retirement 
plan that are used to pay the premiums 
for coverage by an accident or health 
plan or a long-term care insurance con-
tract. The premiums can be for coverage 
for you, your spouse, or dependents. The 
distribution must be from the plan main-
tained by the employer from which you 
retired as a public safety officer. The 
distribution can be made directly from 
the plan to the provider of the accident 
or health plan or long-term care insur-
ance contract, or the distribution can be 
made to you to pay to the provider of the 
accident or health plan or long-term care 
insurance contract. You can exclude 
from income the smaller of the amount 
of the premiums paid or $3,000. You can 
make this election only for amounts that 

Simplified Method

You must use the Simplified Method if 
either of the following applies.

If you are retired on disability and re-
porting your disability pension on 
line 1h, include only the taxable amount 
on that line and enter “PSO” and the 
amount excluded on the dotted line next 
to line 1h.
Payments when you are disabled. If 
you receive payments from a retirement 
or profit-sharing plan that does not pro-
vide for disability retirement, do not 
treat those payments as disability pay-
ments. The payments must be reported 
as a pension or annuity.

1. Your annuity starting date was af-
ter July 1, 1986, and you used this meth-
od last year to figure the taxable part.

2. Your annuity starting date was af-
ter November 18, 1996, and both of the 
following apply.

a.
The payments are from a quali-
fied employee plan, a qualified employ-
ee annuity, or a tax-sheltered annuity.

b. On your annuity starting date, ei-
ther you were under age 75 or the num-
ber of years of guaranteed payments was 
fewer than 5. See Pub. 575 for the defi-
nition of guaranteed payments.

You must include in your income any 
amounts that you received that you 
would have received in retirement had 
you not become disabled as a result of a 
terrorist attack. Include in your income 
any payments you receive from a 
401(k), pension, or other retirement plan 
to the extent that you would have re-
ceived the amount at the same or later

Annuity Starting Date

Your annuity starting date is the later of 
the first day of the first period for which 
you received a payment or the date the 
plan's obligations became fixed.

Lump-Sum Distributions

• You file Form 2555, 4563, or

If you received a lump-sum distribution 
from a profit-sharing or retirement plan, 
your Form 1099-R should have the "To-
tal distribution" box in box 2b checked. 
You may owe an additional tax if you re-
ceived an early distribution from a quali-
fied retirement plan and the total amount 
wasn't rolled over. For details, see the

Disability payments. Don’t include in 
your income any disability payments 
(including Social Security Disability In-
surance (SSDI) payments) you receive 
for injuries incurred as a direct result of 
a terrorist attack directed against the 
United States (or its allies), whether out-
side or within the United States. In the 
case of the September 11 attacks, inju-
ries eligible for coverage by the Septem-
ber 11 Victim Compensation Fund are 
treated as incurred as a direct result of 
the attack. If these payments are incor-
rectly reported as taxable on Form 
SSA-1099, don't include the nontaxable 
portion of income on your tax return. 
You may receive a notice from the IRS 
regarding the omitted payments. Follow

that the excluded payments aren't taxa-
ble. For more information about these 
payments, see Pub. 3920.

Your cost is generally your net invest-
ment in the plan as of the annuity start-
ing date. It doesn't include pre-tax con-
tributions. Your net investment may be 
shown in box 9b of Form 1099-R.

You should receive a Form SSA-1099 
showing in box 3 the total social securi-
ty benefits paid to you. Box 4 will show 
the amount of any benefits you repaid in 
2023. If you received railroad retirement 
benefits treated as social security, you 
should receive a Form RRB-1099.

Rollovers

Generally, a rollover is a tax-free distri-
bution of cash or other assets from one 
retirement plan that is contributed to an-
other plan within 60 days of receiving 
the distribution. However, a rollover to a 
Roth IRA or a designated Roth account 
is generally not a tax-free distribution. 
Use lines 5a and 5b to report a rollover, 
including a direct rollover, from one 
qualified employer's plan to another or 
to an IRA or SEP.

CAUTION
!

Accrued leave payment. If you retire 
on disability, any lump-sum payment 
you receive for accrued annual leave is a 
salary payment. The payment is not a 
disability payment. Include it in your in-
come in the tax year you receive it.

Line 6c

Check the box on line 6c if you elect to 
use the lump-sum election method for 
your benefits. If any of your benefits are 
taxable for 2023 and they include a 
lump-sum benefit payment that was for 
an earlier year, you may be able to re-
duce the taxable amount with the 
lump-sum election. See Lump-Sum Elec-
tion in Pub. 915 for details.

If Exception 1 applies, enter your to-
tal capital gain distributions (from 
box 2a of Form(s) 1099-DIV) on line 7 
and check the box on that line. If you re-
ceived capital gain distributions as a 
nominee (that is, they were paid to you 
but actually belong to someone else), re-
port on line 7 only the amount that be-
longs to you. Include a statement show-
ing the full amount you received and the 
amount you received as a nominee. See 
the Schedule B instructions for filing re-
quirements for Forms 1099-DIV and 
1096.

Standard Deduction

Most Form 1040 filers can find their 
standard deduction by looking at the 
amounts listed to the left of line 12. 
Most Form 1040-SR filers can find their 
standard deduction by using the chart on 
the last page of Form 1040-SR.
Exception 
1—Dependent. If 
you 
checked the “Someone can claim you as 
a dependent” box, or if you’re filing 
jointly and you checked the “Someone 
can claim your spouse as a dependent” 
box, use the Standard Deduction Work-
sheet for Dependents to figure your 
standard deduction.

Form 8949 or Schedule D if you aren’t 
deferring any capital gain by investing 
in a qualified opportunity fund and both 
of the following apply.

If you don’t have to file Sched-
ule D, use the Qualified Divi-
dends and Capital Gain Tax 
Worksheet in the line 16 instructions to 
figure your tax.

spouse as a dependent if they 
list your or your spouse's name 
and SSN in the Dependents section of 
their return.

form you use (Form 8995 or 8995-A) to 
your return. See the Instructions for 
Forms 8995 and 8995-A for more infor-
mation for figuring and reporting your

instructions for information on figuring 
and claiming any child tax credit and 
credit for other dependents that you may 
qualify to claim.
Form 8862, who must file. You must 
file Form 8862 to claim the child tax 
credit or credit for other dependents if 
your child tax credit (refundable or non-
refundable depending on the tax year), 
additional child tax credit, or credit for 
other dependents for a year after 2015 
was denied or reduced for any reason 
other than a math or clerical error. At-
tach a completed Form 8862 to your 
2023 return to claim the credit for 2023. 
Don’t file Form 8862 if you filed Form 
8862 for 2022, and the child tax credit, 
additional child tax credit, or credit for 
other dependents was allowed for that 
year. See Form 8862 and its instructions 
for details.

Enter any estimated federal income tax 
payments you made for 2023. Include 
any overpayment that you applied to 
your 2023 estimated tax from your 2022 
return or an amended return (Form 
1040-X).

Line 25a—Form(s) W-2

Add the amounts shown as federal in-
come tax withheld on your Form(s) 
W-2. Enter the total on line 25a. The 
amount withheld should be shown in 
box 2 of Form W-2. Attach your 
Form(s) W-2 to your return.

If you and your spouse paid joint esti-
mated tax but are now filing separate in-
come tax returns, you can divide the 
amount paid in any way you choose as 
long as you both agree. If you can't 
agree, you must divide the payments in 
proportion to each spouse's individual 
tax as shown on your separate returns 
for 2023. For more information, see 
Pub. 505. Be sure to show both SSNs in 
the space provided on the separate re-
turns. If you or your spouse paid sepa-
rate estimated tax but you are now filing 
a joint return, add the amounts you each 
paid. Follow these instructions even if 
your spouse died in 2023 or in 2024 be-
fore filing a 2023 return.
Divorced taxpayers. If you got di-
vorced in 2023 and you made joint esti-
mated tax payments with your former 
spouse, enter your former spouse's SSN 
in the space provided on the front of 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you were di-
vorced and remarried in 2023, enter 
your present spouse's SSN in the space 
provided on the front of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. Also, on the dotted line next 
to line 26, enter your former spouse's 
SSN, followed by “DIV.”
Name change. If you changed your 
name and you made estimated tax pay-
ments using your former name, attach a 
statement to the front of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR that explains all the payments 
you and your spouse made in 2023 and 
the name(s) and SSN(s) under which 
you made them.

Line 25b—Form(s) 1099

Include on line 25b any federal income 
tax withheld on your Form(s) 1099-R. 
The amount withheld should be shown 
in box 4. Attach your Form(s) 1099-R to 
the front of your return if federal income 
tax was withheld.

If you received a 2023 Form 1099 
showing federal income tax withheld on 
dividends, taxable or tax-exempt interest 
income, unemployment compensation, 
social security benefits, railroad retire-
ment benefits, or other income you re-
ceived, include the amount withheld in 
the total on line 25b. This should be 
shown in box 4 of Form 1099, box 6 of 
Form SSA-1099, or box 10 of Form 
RRB-1099.

If you take the child tax credit 
or credit for other dependents 
even though you aren't eligible 
and it is determined that your error is 
due to reckless or intentional disregard 
of the rules for these credits, you won't 
be allowed to take either credit or the 
additional child tax credit for 2 years 
even if you're otherwise eligible to do so. 
If you take the child tax credit or credit 
for other dependents even though you 
aren’t eligible and it is later determined 
that you fraudulently took either credit, 
you won't be allowed to take either cred-
it or the additional child tax credit for 
10 years. You may also have to pay pen-
alties.

CAUTION
!


Line 25c—Other Forms

Include on line 25c any federal income 
tax withheld on your Form(s) W-2G. 
The amount withheld should be shown 
in box 4. Attach Form(s) W-2G to the 
front of your return if federal income tax 
was withheld.

If you had Additional Medicare Tax 
withheld, include the amount shown on 
Form 8959, line 24, in the total on 
line 25c. Attach Form 8959.

If your qualifying child didn’t 
have an SSN valid for employ-
ment issued before the due date 
of your 2023 return (including exten-
sions), you can’t claim the child tax 
credit for that child on your original or 
amended return. However, you may be 
able to claim the credit for other de-
pendents for that child.

CAUTION
!

Include on line 25c any federal in-
come tax withheld that is shown on a 
Schedule K-1.

Also include on line 25c any tax 
withheld that is shown on Form 1042-S,

Definitions and Special Rules

If you and your spouse both received Medicaid waiver 

payments during the year, you and your spouse can make different 
choices about including the full amount of your payments in earned 
income. Enter only the amount of Medicaid waiver payments that you 
or your spouse, if filing a joint return, do not want to include in earned 
income. To include all nontaxable Medicaid waiver payment amounts in 
earned income, enter -0-.

Adopted child. An adopted child is always treated as your own 
child. An adopted child includes a child lawfully placed with 
you for legal adoption.

Church employees. Determine how much of the amount on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a, was also reported on Sched-
ule SE, Part I, line 5a. Subtract that amount from the amount on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a, and enter the result on line 1 of 
the worksheet in Step 5 (instead of entering the actual amount 
from Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a). Be sure to answer “Yes” 
to question 2 in Step 5.
Clergy. The following instructions apply to ministers, members 
of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty, and

reason other than a math or clerical error. But don’t file Form 
8862 if either of the following applies.

• You filed Form 8862 for another year, the EIC was al-
lowed for that year, and your EIC hasn't been reduced or disal-
lowed again for any reason other than a math or clerical error.

1. Enter “Clergy” on the dotted line next to line 27.
2. Determine how much of the amount on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, line 1z, was also reported on Schedule SE, Part I, 
line 2.

• You are taking the EIC without a qualifying child and the 
only reason your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the other 
year was because it was determined that a child listed on Sched-
ule EIC wasn't your qualifying child.

3. Subtract that amount from the amount on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, line 1z. Enter the result on line 1 of the worksheet in 
Step 5 (instead of entering the actual amount from Form 1040 
or 1040-SR, line 1z).

 Also, don’t file Form 8862 or take the credit for the:

• 2 years after the most recent tax year for which there was 
a final determination that your EIC claim was due to reckless or 
intentional disregard of the EIC rules, or

4. Be sure to answer “Yes” to question 2 in Step 5.

• 10 years after the most recent tax year for which there was 
a final determination that your EIC claim was due to fraud.
Foster child. A foster child is any child placed with you by an 
authorized placement agency or by judgment, decree, or other 
order of any court of competent jurisdiction. For more details on 
authorized placement agencies, see Pub. 596.

Combat pay, nontaxable. If you were a member of the U.S. 
Armed Forces who served in a combat zone, certain pay is ex-
cluded from your income. See Combat Zone Exclusion in Pub. 
3. You can elect to include this pay in your earned income when 
figuring the EIC. The amount of your nontaxable combat pay 
should be shown in box 12 of Form(s) W-2 with code Q. If you 
are filing a joint return and both you and your spouse received 
nontaxable combat pay, you can each make your own election. 
In other words, if one of you makes the election, the other one 
can also make it but doesn't have to.

Married child. A child who was married at the end of 2023 is 
a qualifying child only if (a) you can claim the child as your de-
pendent, or (b) you could have claimed the child as your de-
pendent except for the special rule for Children of divorced or 
separated parents under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, ear-
lier.
Members of the military. If you were on extended active duty 
outside the United States, your main home is considered to be in 
the United States during that duty period. Extended active duty 
is military duty ordered for an indefinite period or for a period 
of more than 90 days. Once you begin serving extended active 
duty, you are considered to be on extended active duty even if 
you don’t serve more than 90 days.

If you elect to use your nontaxable combat pay in fig-
uring your EIC, enter that amount on line 1i.

CAUTION
!


Credit figured by the IRS. To have the IRS figure your EIC:

1. Enter “EIC” on the dotted line next to line 27.
2. Be sure you enter the nontaxable combat pay you elect to 
include in earned income by entering that amount on line 1i. 
See Combat pay, nontaxable, earlier.

3. If you have a qualifying child, complete and attach 
Schedule EIC. If your EIC for a year after 1996 was reduced or 
disallowed, see Form 8862, who must file, later.

Nonresident aliens. If your filing status is married filing joint-
ly, go to Step 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't take the EIC. Enter 
“No” on the dotted line next to line 27.

Exception to time lived with you. Temporary absences by you 
or the child for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, 
business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juve-
nile facility, count as time the child lived with you. Also see 
Kidnapped child under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, earli-
er, and Members of the military, later. A child is considered to 
have lived with you for more than half of 2023 if the child was 
born or died in 2023 and your home was this child's home for 
more than half the time the child was alive in 2023 or if you 
adopted the child in 2023, the child was lawfully placed with 
you for legal adoption by you in 2023, or the child was an eligi-
ble foster child placed with you during 2023 and your main 
home was the child's main home for more than half the time 
since the child was adopted or placed with you in 2023.

Permanently and totally disabled. A person is permanently 
and totally disabled if, at any time in 2023, the person couldn't 
engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical 
or mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condi-
tion (a) has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at 
least a year, or (b) can be expected to lead to death.

Qualifying child of more than one person. Even if a child 
meets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one 
person, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child 
for all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for 
Children of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies 
as Your Dependent, earlier, applies.

1. Child tax credit, credit for other dependents, and addi-
tional child tax credit (lines 19 and 28).

Form 4797 filers. If the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, 
line 7, includes an amount from Form 4797, you must use 
Worksheet 1 in Pub. 596 to see if you can take the EIC. Other-
wise, stop; you can't take the EIC.

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed 
based on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can 
claim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. 
For purposes of these rules, the term “parent” means a biologi-
cal or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a step-
parent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the indi-
vidual.

“Not Valid for Employment” is printed on the social security 
card and the number was issued solely to allow the recipient of 
the SSN to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit. If 
“Not Valid for Employment” is printed on the social security 
card and the card-holder’s immigration status has changed so 
that they are now a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, ask the 
SSA for a new social security card without the legend. Howev-
er, if “Valid for Work Only With DHS Authorization” is printed 
on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes 
only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid.

• If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is 
treated as the qualifying child of the parent.

• If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the 
child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying 
child of the parents.

To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number 

(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't 
have an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You 
Can't File on Time?

• If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both pa-
rents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the 
child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child 
lived for the longer period of time in 2023. If the child lived 
with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat 
the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the high-
er adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2023.

If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of 
your 2023 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC 
on your original or an amended 2023 return. If a child didn't 
have an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (in-
cluding extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying 
child in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an 
amended 2023 return.
Student. A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar 
months of 2023 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school 
or took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or 
a state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a 
technical, trade, or mechanical school. It doesn't include an 
on-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school of-
fering courses only through the Internet.

• If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the 
child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the 
highest AGI for 2023.

• If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no 
parent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualify-
ing child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2023, but 
only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any 
parent of the child who can claim the child.

If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a quali-
fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the 
EIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying 
child. For more information, see Pub. 596.

TIP

Welfare benefits, effect of credit on. Any refund you receive 
as a result of taking the EIC can't be counted as income when 
determining if you or anyone else is eligible for benefits or as-
sistance, or how much you or anyone else can receive, under 
any federal program or under any state or local program fi-
nanced in whole or in part with federal funds. These programs 
include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), 
Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps). In 
addition, when determining eligibility, the refund can't be coun-
ted as a resource for at least 12 months after you receive it. 
Check with your local benefit coordinator to find out if your re-
fund will affect your benefits.

Example. Your child Lee, meets the conditions to be a quali-
fying child for both you and your parent. Lee doesn't meet the 
conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, includ-
ing Lee’s other parent. Under the rules just described, you can 
claim Lee as a qualifying child for all of the five tax benefits lis-
ted here for which you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't 
claim any of the five tax benefits listed here based on Lee. 
However, if your parent’s AGI is higher than yours and you 
don’t claim Lee as a qualifying child, Lee is the qualifying child 
of your parent.

For more details and examples, see Pub. 596.

number issued by the Social Security Administration unless

See Schedule 8812 (Form 1040) and its 
instructions for information on figuring 
and claiming any additional child tax 
credit that you may qualify to claim. If 
you are claiming the additional child tax 
credit, complete Schedule 8812 and at-
tach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Form 8862, who must file. You must 
file Form 8862 to claim the additional 
child tax credit if your child tax credit 
(refundable or nonrefundable depending 
on the tax year), additional child tax 
credit, or credit for other dependents for 
a year after 2015 was denied or reduced 
for any reason other than a math or cleri-
cal error. Attach a completed Form 8862 
to your 2023 return to claim the credit 
for 2023. Don't file Form 8862 if you 
filed Form 8862 for 2022 and the child 
tax credit, additional child tax credit, or 
credit for other dependents was allowed 
for that year. See Form 8862 and its in-
structions for details.

If you meet the requirements to claim an 
education credit (see the instructions for 
Schedule 3, line 3), enter on line 29 the 
amount, if any, from Form 8863, line 8. 
You may be able to increase an educa-
tion credit and reduce your total tax or 
increase your tax refund if the student 
chooses to include all or part of a Pell 
grant or certain other scholarships or fel-
lowships in income. See Pub. 970 and 
the Instructions for Form 8863 for more 
information.
Form 8862 required. You must file 
Form 8862 to claim the American op-
portunity credit if your American oppor-
tunity credit for a year after 2015 was 
denied or reduced for any reason other 
than a math or clerical error. Attach a 
completed Form 8862 to your 2023 re-
turn to claim the credit for 2023. Don't 
file Form 8862 if you filed Form 8862 
for 2022 and the American opportunity 
credit was allowed for that year. See 
Form 8862 and its instructions for de-
tails.

Amount Overpaid

If line 34 is under $1, we will send a re-
fund only on written request.

Refund Offset

If you owe past-due federal tax, state in-
come tax, state unemployment compen-
sation debts, child support, spousal sup-
port, or certain federal nontax debts, 
such as student loans, all or part of the 
overpayment on line 34 may be used 
(offset) to pay the past-due amount. Off-
sets for federal taxes are made by the 
IRS. All other offsets are made by the 
Treasury Department's Bureau of the 
Fiscal Service. For federal tax offsets, 
you will receive a notice from the IRS. 
For all other offsets, you will receive a 
notice from the Fiscal Service. To find 
out if you may have an offset or if you 
have any questions about it, contact the 
agency to which you owe the debt.

If you take the additional child 
tax credit even though you 
aren't eligible and it is deter-
mined that your error is due to reckless 
or intentional disregard of the additional 
child tax credit rules, you won't be al-
lowed to take the child tax credit, the 
credit for other dependents, or the addi-
tional child tax credit for 2 years even if 
you’re otherwise eligible to do so. If you 
take the additional child tax credit even 
though you aren’t eligible and it is later 
determined that you fraudulently took 
the credit, you won't be allowed to take 
the child tax credit, the credit for other 
dependents, or the additional child tax 
credit for 10 years. You may also have to 
pay penalties.

CAUTION
!

Deposit Refund Into Multiple 
Accounts

If you take the American oppor-
tunity credit even though you 
aren't eligible and it is deter-
mined that your error is due to reckless 
or intentional disregard of the American 
opportunity credit rules, you won't be al-
lowed to take the credit for 2 years even 
if you’re otherwise eligible to do so. If 
you take the American opportunity cred-
it even though you aren't eligible and it 
is determined that you fraudulently took 
the credit, you won't be allowed to take 
the credit for 10 years. You may also 
have to pay penalties.

CAUTION
!

If you want your refund to be split and 
direct deposited into more than one ac-
count, file Form 8888. Use Form 8888 
to direct deposit your refund (or part of 
it) to one or more accounts in your name 
at a bank or other financial institution 
(such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, 
or credit union) in the United States.

Injured Spouse

If you file a joint return and your spouse 
hasn’t paid past-due federal tax, state in-
come tax, state unemployment compen-
sation debts, child support, spousal sup-
port, or a federal nontax debt, such as a 
student loan, part or all of the overpay-
ment on line 34 may be used (offset) to 
pay the past-due amount. But your part 
of the overpayment may be refunded to 
you if certain conditions apply and you 
complete Form 8379. For details, see 
Form 8379.

Line 30
Line 30 has been reserved for future use.

Refunds for returns claiming 
the additional child tax credit 
can't be issued before mid-Feb-
ruary 2024. This delay applies to the en-
tire refund, not just the portion associ-
ated with the additional child tax credit.

Lines 35a Through 35d

DIRECT DEPOSIT

Simple. Safe. Secure.

Amount Refunded to You

• It's proven itself. Nearly 98% of 
social security and veterans' benefits are 
sent electronically using direct deposit.

Fast Refunds! Join the eight in 10 taxpayers 
who choose direct deposit—a fast, simple, safe, 
secure way to have your refund deposited 
automatically to your checking or savings 
account, including an individual retirement 
arrangement (IRA). See the information about 
IRAs, later.

If you want to check the status of your 
refund, just use the IRS2Go app or go to 
IRS.gov/Refunds. See Refund Informa-
tion, later. Information about your re-
fund will generally be available within 
24 hours after the IRS receives your 
e-filed return, or 4 weeks after you mail 
your paper return. If you filed Form 
8379 with your return, wait 14 weeks 
(11 weeks if you filed electronically). 
Have your 2023 tax return handy so you 
can enter your social security number, 
your filing status, and the exact whole 
dollar amount of your refund.

If you file a joint return and 
check the box on line 35a and 
attach Form 8888 or fill in 
lines 35b through 35d, your spouse may 
get at least part of the refund.

CAUTION
!


If you want us to directly deposit the 
amount shown on line 35a to your 
checking, savings, health savings, bro-
kerage or other similar account, includ-
ing an IRA, at a bank or other financial 
institution (such as a mutual fund, bro-
kerage firm, or credit union) in the Uni-
ted States:

IRA. You can have your refund (or part 
of it) directly deposited to a traditional 
IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP-IRA, but not a 
SIMPLE IRA. You must establish the 
IRA at a bank or other financial institu-
tion before you request direct deposit. 
Make sure your direct deposit will be 
accepted. You must also notify the trust-
ee or custodian of your account of the 
year to which the deposit is to be applied 
(unless the trustee or custodian won't ac-
cept a deposit for 2023). If you don’t, 
the trustee or custodian can assume the 
deposit is for the year during which you 
are filing the return. For example, if you 
file your 2023 return during 2024 and 
don’t notify the trustee or custodian in 
advance, the trustee or custodian can as-
sume the deposit to your IRA is for 
2024. If you designate your deposit to be 
for 2023, you must verify that the depos-
it was actually made to the account by 
the due date of the return (not counting 
extensions). If the deposit isn't made by 
that date, the deposit isn't an IRA contri-
bution for 2023. In that case, you must 
file an amended 2023 return and reduce 
any IRA deduction and any retirement 
savings contributions credit you claim-
ed.

Where's My Refund will provide a 
personalized refund date as soon as the

Claiming a refund for a deceased tax-
payer. If you are filing a joint return 
with your deceased spouse, you only 
need to file the tax return to claim the 
refund. If you are a court-appointed rep-
resentative, file the return and include a 
copy of the certificate that shows your 
appointment. All other filers requesting 
the deceased taxpayer's refund must file 
the return and attach Form 1310.
Effect of refund on benefits. Any re-
fund you receive can't be counted as in-
come when determining if you or any-
one else is eligible for benefits or 
assistance, or how much you or anyone 
else can receive, under any federal pro-
gram or under any state or local program 
financed in whole or in part with federal 
funds. These programs include Tempo-
rary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF), Medicaid, Supplemental Secur-
ity Income (SSI), and Supplemental Nu-
trition Assistance Program (formerly 
food stamps). In addition, when deter-
mining eligibility, the refund can't be 
counted as a resource for at least 12 
months after you receive it. Check with 
your local benefit coordinator to find out 
if your refund will affect your benefits.

• Complete lines 35b through 35d (if 
you want your refund deposited to only 
one account), or

• Check the box on line 35a and at-
tach Form 8888 if you want to split the 
direct deposit of your refund into more 
than one account or use all or part of 
your refund to buy paper series I savings 
bonds.

If you don’t want your refund directly 
deposited to your account, don’t check 
the box on line 35a. Draw a line through 
the boxes on lines 35b and 35d. We will 
send you a check instead.
Account must be in your name. Don’t 
request a deposit of your refund to an 
account that isn't in your name, such as 
your tax return preparer’s account. Al-
though you may owe your tax return 
preparer a fee for preparing your return, 
don’t have any part of your refund de-
posited into the preparer's account to pay 
the fee.

You and your spouse, if filing 
jointly, each may be able to 
contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 
if age 50 or older at the end of 2023) to 
a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for 2023. 
You may owe a penalty if your contribu-
tions exceed these limits, and the limits 
may be lower depending on your com-
pensation and income. For more infor-
mation on IRA contributions, see Pub. 
590-A.

CAUTION
!

The number of refunds that can be di-
rectly deposited to a single account or 
prepaid debit card is limited to three a 
year. After this limit is reached, paper 
checks will be sent instead. Learn more 
at IRS.gov/DepositLimit.

Why Use Direct Deposit?

• You get your refund faster by di-
rect deposit than you do by check.

• Payment is more secure. There is 
no check that can get lost or stolen.

For more information on IRAs, see 
Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B.

Amount You Owe

• Electronic Funds Withdrawal 

To avoid interest and penalties, 
pay your taxes in full by the 
due date of your return (not in-
cluding extensions)—April 15, 2024, for 
most taxpayers. You don’t have to pay if 
line 37 is under $1.

tion offered when filing your federal 
taxes electronically using tax return 
preparation software, through a tax pro-
fessional, or the IRS at IRS.gov/
Payments.

TIP


• Online Payment Agreement. If 
you can’t pay in full by the due date of 
your tax return, you can apply for an on-
line monthly installment agreement at 
IRS.gov/OPA. Once you complete the 
online process, you will receive immedi-
ate notification of whether your agree-
ment has been approved. A user fee is 
charged.

Include any estimated tax penalty 
from line 38 in the amount you enter on 
line 37. Don’t include any estimated 
payments for 2024 in this payment. In-
stead, make the estimated payment sepa-
rately.
Bad check or payment. The penalty 
for writing a bad check to the IRS is $25 
or 2% of the check, whichever is more. 
However, if the amount of the check is 
less than $25, the penalty equals the 
amount of the check. This also applies to 
other forms of payment if the IRS 
doesn’t receive the funds. Use Tax Topic 
206.

on Apply for an Online Payment Plan.
Extension of time to pay. If paying the 
tax when it is due would cause you an 
undue hardship, you can ask for an ex-
tension of time to pay by filing Form 
1127 by the due date of your return (not 
counting extensions)—April 15, 2024, 
for most people. An extension generally 
won't be granted for more than 6 
months. You will be charged interest on 
the tax not paid by April 15, 2024. You 
must pay the tax before the extension 
runs out. If you do not pay the tax by the 
extended due date, penalties and interest 
will be imposed until taxes are paid in 
full. For the most up-to-date information 
on Form 1127, go to IRS.gov/Form1127.

1. You had no tax shown on your 
2022 return and you were a U.S. citizen 
or resident for all of 2022.

2. The total of lines 25d, 26, and 
Schedule 3, line 11, on your 2023 return 
is at least 100% of the tax shown on 
your 2022 return (110% of that amount 
if you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and 
your adjusted gross income (AGI) 
shown on your 2022 return was more 
than $150,000 (more than $75,000 if 
married filing separately for 2023)). 
Your estimated tax payments for 2023 
must have been made on time and for 
the required amount.

Notice 
to 
taxpayers 
presenting 

checks. When you provide a check as 
payment, you authorize us either to use 
information from your check to make a 
one-time electronic fund transfer from 
your account or to process the payment 
as a check transaction. When we use in-
formation from your check to make an 
electronic fund transfer, funds may be 
withdrawn from your account as soon as 
the same day we receive your payment, 
and you will not receive your check 
back from your financial institution.

For most people, the “tax shown on 
your 2022 return” is the amount on your 
2022 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24, 
minus the total of any amounts shown 
on lines 27, 28, and 29; Schedule 3, 
lines 9, 12, 13b, and 13h; and Forms 
8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III through IX 
only), and 8919. Also subtract from 
line 24 any:

No checks of $100 million or more 

accepted. The IRS can’t accept a single 
check (including a cashier’s check) for 
amounts of $100,000,000 ($100 million) 
or more. If you are sending $100 million 
or more by check, you’ll need to spread 
the payment over 2 or more checks with 
each check made out for an amount less 
than $100 million. This limit doesn’t ap-
ply to other methods of payment (such 
as electronic payments). Please consider 
a method of payment other than check if 
the amount of the payment is over $100 
million.

Line 38

Estimated Tax Penalty

You may owe this penalty if:

• Line 37 is at least $1,000 and it is 
more than 10% of the tax shown on your 
return, or

• Tax on an excess parachute pay-
ment,

• You didn't pay enough estimated 
tax by any of the due dates. This is true 
even if you are due a refund.

• Excise tax on insider stock com-
pensation of an expatriated corporation,

• Uncollected social security and 
Medicare or RRTA tax on tips or 
group-term life insurance, and

For most people, the “tax shown on 
your return” is the amount on your 2023 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24, minus 
the total of any amounts shown on lines 
27, 28, and 29; Schedule 3, lines 9 and 
12; Schedule H, lines 8e and 8f; and 
Forms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III 
through IX only), and 8919. Also sub-
tract from line 24 any:

• Look-back interest due under sec-
tion 167(g) or 460(b).
When figuring the amount on line 24, 
include household employment taxes 
only if line 25d is more than zero or you 
would have owed the estimated tax pen-
alty for 2022 even if you didn't include 
those taxes.

What if You Can't Pay?

If you can't pay the full amount shown 
on line 37 when you file, you can ask 
for:

• An installment agreement, or
• An extension of time to pay.

Installment agreement. Under an in-
stallment agreement, you can pay all or 
part of the tax you owe in monthly in-
stallments. However, even if an install-
ment agreement is granted, you will be 
charged interest and may be charged a 
late payment penalty on the tax not paid 
by the due date of your return (not 
counting extensions)—April 15, 2024, 
for most people. You must also pay a 
fee. To limit the interest and penalty 
charges, pay as much of the tax as possi-
ble when you file. But before requesting 
an installment agreement, you should 
consider other less costly alternatives, 
such as a bank loan or credit card pay-
ment.

• Tax on an excess parachute pay-
ment,

If the Exception just described 
doesn't apply, see the Instructions for 
Form 2210 for other situations in which 
you may be able to lower your penalty 
by filing Form 2210.

• Excise tax on insider stock com-
pensation of an expatriated corporation,

• Uncollected social security and 
Medicare or RRTA tax on tips or 
group-term life insurance,

Figuring the Penalty

• Look-back interest due under sec-
tion 167(g) or 460(b),
When figuring the amount on line 24, 
include household employment taxes 
only if line 25d is more than zero or you 
would owe the penalty even if you didn't 
include those taxes.
Exception. You won't owe the penalty 
if your 2022 tax return was for a tax 
year of 12 full months and either of the 
following applies.

If you choose to figure the penalty your-
self, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farm-
ers and fishermen).

Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the 
penalty to any tax due and enter the total 
on line 37.

However, if you have an overpay-
ment on line 34, subtract the penalty 
from the amount you would otherwise 
enter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a, 
36, and 38 must equal line 34.

To ask for an installment agreement, 
you can apply online or use Form 9465. 


62

If the penalty is more than the over-
payment on line 34, enter -0- on lines 
35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from 
line 38 and enter the result on line 37.

we issued you an identity protection per-
sonal identification number (IP PIN) (as 
described in more detail below), all six 
digits of your IP PIN must appear in the 
IP PIN spaces provided next to the space 
for your occupation for your electronic 
signature to be complete. Failure to in-
clude an issued IP PIN on the electronic 
return will result in an invalid signature 
and a rejected return. If you are filing a 
joint return and both taxpayers were is-
sued an IP PIN, enter both IP PINs in 
the spaces provided.
Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN 
method allows you to create your own 
PIN. If you are married filing jointly, 
you and your spouse will each need to 
create a PIN and enter these PINs as 
your electronic signatures.

Sign Your Return

Form 1040 or 1040-SR isn't considered 
a valid return unless you sign it in ac-
cordance with the requirements in these 
instructions. If you are filing a joint re-
turn, your spouse must also sign. If your 
spouse can't sign the return, see Pub. 
501. Be sure to date your return and en-
ter your occupation(s). If you have 
someone prepare your return, you are 
still responsible for the correctness of 
the return. If your return is signed by a 
representative for you, you must have a 
power of attorney attached that specifi-
cally authorizes the representative to 
sign your return. To do this, you can use 
Form 2848. If you are filing a joint re-
turn with your spouse who died in 2023, 
see Death of a Taxpayer, earlier.

Don’t file Form 2210 with your re-
turn unless Form 2210 indicates that you 
must do so. Instead, keep it for your re-
cords.

Because Form 2210 is compli-
cated, you can leave line 38 
blank and the IRS will figure 
the penalty and send you a bill. We won't 
charge you interest on the penalty if you 
pay by the date specified on the bill. 
There are situations where the IRS can't 
figure your penalty for you and you must 
file Form 2210. See Form 2210 for de-
tails.

TIP


A PIN is any combination of five dig-
its you choose except five zeros. If you 
use a PIN, there is nothing to sign and 
nothing to mail—not even your Forms 
W-2.

Third Party Designee
If you want to allow your preparer, a 
friend, a family member, or any other 
person you choose to discuss your 2023 
tax return with the IRS, check the “Yes” 
box in the “Third Party Designee” area 
of your return. Also enter the designee's 
name, phone number, and any five digits 
the designee chooses as their personal 
identification number (PIN).

Court-Appointed 
Conservator, Guardian, or 
Other Fiduciary

Your electronic return is considered a 
validly signed return only when it in-
cludes your PIN, last name, date of 
birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your ad-
justed gross income (AGI) from your 
originally filed 2022 federal income tax 
return, if applicable. If you're filing 
jointly, your electronic return must also 
include your spouse's PIN, last name, 
date of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and 
AGI, if applicable, in order to be consid-
ered validly signed. Don’t use your AGI 
from an amended return (Form 1040-X) 
or a math error correction made by the 
IRS. AGI is the amount shown on your 
2022 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. If 
you don’t have your 2022 income tax re-
turn, call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get 
a free transcript of your return or visit 
IRS.gov/Transcript. (If you filed elec-
tronically last year, you, and your 
spouse if filing jointly, may use your pri-
or year PIN to verify your identity in-
stead of your prior year AGI. The prior 
year PIN is the five-digit PIN you used 
to electronically sign your 2022 return.)

If you are a court-appointed conservator, 
guardian, or other fiduciary for a men-
tally or physically incompetent individu-
al who has to file Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, sign your name for the indi-
vidual and file Form 56.

If you check the “Yes” box, you, and 
your spouse if filing a joint return, are 
authorizing the IRS to call the designee 
to answer any questions that may arise 
during the processing of your return. 
You are also authorizing the designee to:

Child's Return

If your child can't sign their return, ei-
ther parent can sign the child's name in 
the space provided. Then, enter “By 
(your signature), parent for minor 
child.”

• Give the IRS any information that 
is missing from your return;

• Call the IRS for information about 
the processing of your return or the sta-
tus of your refund or payment(s);

Requirements for a Paper 
Return

• Receive copies of notices or tran-
scripts related to your return, upon re-
quest; and

You must handwrite your signature on 
your return if you file it on paper. Digi-
tal, electronic, or typed-font signatures 
are not valid signatures for Forms 1040 
or 1040-SR filed on paper.

• Respond to certain IRS notices 
about math errors, offsets, and return 
preparation.

Requirements for an 
Electronic Return

You aren't authorizing the designee to 
receive any refund check, bind you to 
anything (including any additional tax 
liability), or otherwise represent you be-
fore the IRS. If you want to expand the 
designee's authorization, see Pub. 947.

To file your return electronically, you 
must sign the return electronically using 
a personal identification number (PIN) 
and provide the information described 
below. If you are filing online using 
software, you must use a Self-Select 
PIN. If you are filing electronically us-
ing a tax practitioner, you can use a 
Self-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. If 

You can't use the Self-Select 
PIN method if you are a 
first-time filer under age 16 at 
the end of 2023.

CAUTION
!

This authorization will automatically 
end no later than the due date (not 
counting extensions) for filing your 
2024 tax return. This is April 15, 2025, 
for most people.

Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN 
method allows you to authorize your tax 
practitioner to enter or generate your

PIN. Your electronic return is considered 
a validly signed return only when it in-
cludes your PIN, last name, date of 
birth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're 
filing jointly, your electronic return must 
also include your spouse's PIN, last 
name, date of birth, and IP PIN, if appli-
cable in order to be considered validly 
signed. The practitioner can provide you 
with details.
Form 8453. You must send in a paper 
Form 8453 if you have to attach certain 
forms or other documents that can't be 
electronically filed. See Form 8453.

If you are filing a joint return and 
both taxpayers receive an IP PIN, enter 
both IP PINs in the spaces provided.

If your paid preparer is self-em-
ployed, then they should check the 
“self-employed” checkbox.

If you need more information, includ-
ing how to retrieve your IP PIN online 
go to IRS.gov/IPPIN. If you’re unable to 
retrieve your IP PIN online, you can call 
800-908-4490.

Assemble Your 
Return

Assemble any schedules and forms be-
hind Form 1040 or 1040-SR in order of 
the “Attachment Sequence No.” shown 
in the upper-right corner of the schedule 
or form. If you have supporting state-
ments, arrange them in the same order as 
the schedules or forms they support and 
attach them last. File your return, sched-
ules, and other attachments on standard 
size paper. Cutting the paper may cause 
problems in processing your return. 
Don’t attach correspondence or other 
items unless required to do so. Attach 
Forms W-2 and 2439 to Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. If you received a Form W-2c 
(a corrected Form W-2), attach your 
original Forms W-2 and any Forms 
W-2c. Attach Forms W-2G and 1099-R 
to Form 1040 or 1040-SR if tax was 
withheld.

Phone Number and Email 
Address

You have the option of entering your 
phone number and email address in the 
spaces provided. There will be no effect 
on the processing of your return if you 
choose not to enter this information. 
Note that the IRS initiates most contacts 
through regular mail delivered by the 
United States Postal Service.

Identity Protection 
PIN

All taxpayers are now eligible 
for an Identity Protection Per-
sonal Identification Number 
(IP PIN). For more information, see 
Pub. 5477. To apply for an IP PIN, go to 
IRS.gov/IPPIN and use the Get an IP 
PIN tool.

TIP

For information on how to report 
phone scams or unsolicited emails 
claiming to be from the IRS, see Secure 
Your Tax Records From Identity Theft, 
later.


Paid Preparer Must 
Sign Your Return

If you received an IP PIN from the IRS, 
enter it in the IP PIN spaces provided 
next to the space for your occupation. 
You must correctly enter all six numbers 
of your IP PIN. If you didn't receive an 
IP PIN, leave these spaces blank.

Generally, anyone you pay to prepare 
your return must sign it and include their 
Preparer Tax Identification Number 
(PTIN) in the space provided. The pre-
parer must give you a copy of the return 
for your records. Someone who prepares 
your return but doesn't charge you 
shouldn’t sign your return.

New IP PINs are generated ev-
ery year. They will generally be 
sent out by mid-January 2024. 
Use this IP PIN on your 2023 return as 
well as any prior-year returns you file in 
2024.

General 
Information

The IRS Mission. Provide America's taxpayers top-quality service by helping them 
understand and meet their tax responsibilities and enforce the law with integrity and 
fairness to all.


• Make sure that if you, your spouse 
with whom you are filing a joint return, 
or your dependent was enrolled in Mar-
ketplace coverage, and advance pay-
ments of the premium tax credit were 
made for the coverage, that you attach 
Form 8962. For tax years other than 
2020, you may have to repay excess ad-
vance payments, even if someone else 
enrolled you, your spouse, or your de-
pendent in the Marketplace coverage. 
Excess advance payments may also have 
to be repaid if you enrolled someone in 
Marketplace coverage, you don't claim 
that individual as a dependent, and no 
one else claims that individual as a de-
pendent. See the instructions for Sched-
ule 2, line 2, and the Instructions for 
Form 8962. You or whoever enrolled 
you should have received Form 1095-A 
from the Marketplace with information 
about who was covered and any advance 
payments of the premium tax credit.

joint or separate return, also enter your 
spouse's SSN. Be sure to enter your SSN 
in the space next to your name. Check 
that your name and SSN agree with your 
social security card.

Voter Registration
Do you need to check or update your 
voter registration? Visit Vote.gov to con-
firm with your state election office.

• Make sure your name and address 
are correct. Enter your (and your spou-
se's) name in the same order as shown 
on your last return.

How To Avoid Common 
Mistakes
Mistakes can delay your refund or result 
in notices being sent to you. One of the 
best ways to file an accurate return is to 
file electronically. Tax software does the 
math for you and will help you avoid 
mistakes. You may be eligible to use 
free tax software that will take the 
guesswork out of preparing your return. 
Free 
File 
makes 
available 
free 
brand-name software and free e-file. 
Visit IRS.gov/FreeFile for details. Join 
the eight in 10 taxpayers who get their 
refunds faster by using direct deposit 
and e-file.

• If you live in an apartment, be sure 
to include your apartment number in 
your address.

• If you are taking the standard de-
duction, see the instructions for line 12 
to be sure you entered the correct 
amount.

• If you received capital gain distri-
butions but weren't required to file 
Schedule D, make sure you checked the 
box on line 7.

• If you are taking the EIC, be sure 
you used the correct column of the EIC 
Table for your filing status and the num-
ber of qualifying children you have who 
have valid SSNs.

• File your return on a standard size 
sheet of paper. Cutting the paper may 
cause problems in processing your re-
turn.

Innocent Spouse Relief
Generally, both you and your spouse are 
each responsible for paying the full 
amount of tax, interest, and penalties on 
your joint return. However, you may 
qualify for relief from liability for tax on 
a joint return if (a) there is an under-
statement of tax because your spouse 
omitted income or claimed false deduc-
tions or credits; (b) you are divorced, 
separated, or no longer living with your 
spouse; or (c) given all the facts and cir-
cumstances, it wouldn't be fair to hold 
you liable for the tax. You may also 
qualify for relief if you were a married 
resident of a community property state 
but didn't file a joint return and are now 
liable for an unpaid or understated tax. 
File Form 8857 to request relief. In 
some cases, Form 8857 may need to be 
filed within 2 years of the date on which 
the IRS first attempted to collect the tax 
from you. Don’t file Form 8857 with 
your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. For more 
information, see Pub. 971 and Form 
8857, or you can call the Innocent 
Spouse office toll free at 855-851-2009.

• Remember to sign and date Form 
1040 or 1040-SR and enter your occupa-
tion(s).

• Make sure you entered the correct 
name and social security number (SSN) 
for each dependent you claim in the De-
pendents section. Check that each de-
pendent's name and SSN agrees with the 
dependent’s social security card. For 
each child under age 17 who is a quali-
fying child for the child tax credit or 
each dependent who qualifies you for 
the credit for other dependents, make 
sure you checked the appropriate box in 
column (4) of the Dependents section.

• Attach your Form(s) W-2 and oth-
er required forms and schedules. Put all 
forms and schedules in the proper order. 
See Assemble Your Return, earlier.

• If you owe tax and are paying by 
check or money order, be sure to include 
all the required information on your pay-
ment. See the instructions for line 37 for 
details.

• Make sure to check Where Do You 

File? before mailing your return. Over 
the next several years, the IRS will be 
reducing the number of paper tax return 
processing sites. Because of this, you 
may need to mail your return to a differ-
ent address than you have in the past.

• Check your math, especially for 
the child tax credit, earned income credit 
(EIC), taxable social security benefits, 
total income, itemized deductions or 
standard deduction, taxable income, to-
tal tax, federal income tax withheld, and 
refund or amount you owe.

• Don’t file more than one original 
return for the same year, even if you 
haven't gotten your refund or haven't 
heard from the IRS since you filed. Fil-
ing more than one original return for the 
same year, or sending in more than one 
copy of the same return (unless we ask 
you to do so), could delay your refund.

• Be sure you used the correct meth-
od to figure your tax. See the instruc-
tions for line 16.

• Be sure to enter your SSN in the 
space provided on page 1 of Form 1040 
or 1040-SR. If you are married filing a

emails, phishing schemes, and phone 
scams. Phishing is the creation and use 
of email and websites designed to mimic 
legitimate business emails and websites. 
The most common form is sending an 
email to a user falsely claiming to be an

a Taxpayer Assistance Center.

The IRS doesn't initiate contact with

doesn't request detailed personal infor-

Identity theft occurs when someone 
uses your personal information, such as 
your name, social security number

How Long Should 
Records Be Kept?
Keep a copy of your tax return, work-
sheets you used, and records of all items 
appearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and 
1099) until the statute of limitations runs 
out for that return. Usually, this is 3 
years from the date the return was due or 
filed or 2 years from the date the tax was 
paid, whichever is later. You should 
keep some records longer. For example, 
keep property records (including those 
on your home) as long as they are nee-

To reduce your risk:
• Protect your SSN,
• Ensure your employer is protecting

was filed or within 2 years after the date 
the tax was paid, whichever is later. But 
you may have more time to file Form

taxes with cash at a participating retail 
store.

Note. You can use Schedule LEP 
(Form 1040), Request for Change in 
Language Preference, to state a prefer-
ence to receive notices, letters, or other 
written communications from the IRS in 
an alternative language. You may not 
immediately receive written communi-
cations in the requested language. The 
IRS’s commitment to LEP taxpayers is 
part of a multi-year timeline that began 
providing translations in 2023. You will 
continue to receive communications, in-
cluding notices and letters in English, 
until they are translated to your prefer-
red language.
Contacting your local TAC. Keep in 
mind, many questions can be answered 
on IRS.gov without visiting a TAC. Go 
to IRS.gov/LetUsHelp for the topics peo-
ple ask about most. If you still need 
help, TACs provide tax help when a tax 
issue can’t be handled online or by 
phone. All TACs now provide service by 
appointment, so you’ll know in advance 
that you can get the service you need 
without long wait times. Before you vis-
it, go to IRS.gov/TACLocator to find the 
nearest TAC and to check hours, availa-
ble services, and appointment options. 
Or, on the IRS2Go app, under the Stay 
Connected tab, choose the Contact Us 
option and click on “Local Offices.”

• Same-Day Wire: You may be able 
to do same-day wire from your financial 
institution. Contact your financial insti-
tution for availability, cost, and time 
frames.

• Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft, the 
IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for 
information on identity theft and data se-
curity protection for taxpayers, tax pro-
fessionals, and businesses. If your SSN 
has been lost or stolen or you suspect 
you’re a victim of tax-related identity 
theft, you can learn what steps you 
should take.

Note. The IRS uses the latest encryp-
tion technology to ensure that the elec-
tronic payments you make online, by 
phone, or from a mobile device using 
the IRS2Go app are safe and secure. 
Paying electronically is quick, easy, and 
faster than mailing in a check or money 
order.
What if I can’t pay now? Go to 
IRS.gov/Payments for more information 
about your options.

• Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP 
PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers as-
signed to taxpayers to help prevent the 
misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent fed-
eral income tax returns. When you have 
an IP PIN, it prevents someone else 
from filing a tax return with your SSN. 
To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN.
Ways to check on the status of your

cepted. Go to IRS.gov/Payments for in-
formation on how to make a payment 
using any of the following options.

Interest and Penalties
You don’t have to figure the amount of 
any interest or penalties you may owe. 
We will send you a bill for any amount 
due.

• IRS Direct Pay: Pay your individu-
al tax bill or estimated tax payment di-
rectly from your checking or savings ac-

Interest

clude it with your return. The penalty 
can be as much as 25% of the tax due. 
The penalty is 15% per month, up to a 
maximum of 75%, if the failure to file is 
fraudulent. If your return is more than 
60 days late, the minimum penalty will 
be $485 or the amount of any tax you 
owe, whichever is smaller.
Late payment of tax. If you pay your 
taxes late, the penalty is usually 1/2 of 
1% of the unpaid amount for each 
month or part of a month the tax isn't 
paid. The penalty can be as much as 
25% of the unpaid amount. It applies to 
any unpaid tax on the return. This penal-
ty is in addition to interest charges on 
late payments.
Frivolous return. In addition to any 
other penalties, the law imposes a penal-
ty of $5,000 for filing a frivolous return. 
A frivolous return is one that doesn't 

contain information needed to figure the 
correct tax or shows a substantially in-
correct tax because you take a frivolous 
position or desire to delay or interfere 
with the tax laws. This includes altering 
or striking out the preprinted language 
above the space where you sign. For a 
list of positions identified as frivolous, 
see Notice 2010-33, 2010-17 I.R.B. 609, 
available 
at 
IRS.gov/irb/

We will charge you interest on taxes not 
paid by their due date, even if an exten-
sion of time to file is granted. We will 
also charge you interest on penalties im-
posed for failure to file, negligence, 
fraud, substantial or gross valuation mis-
statements, substantial understatements 
of tax, and reportable transaction under-
statements. Interest is charged on the 
penalty from the due date of the return 
(including extensions).

2010-17_IRB#NOT-2010-33.
Other. Other penalties can be imposed 
for, among other things, negligence, 
substantial understatement of tax, re-
portable transaction understatements, fil-
ing an erroneous refund claim, and 
fraud. Criminal penalties may be im-
posed for willful failure to file, tax eva-
sion, making a false statement, or identi-
ty theft. See Pub. 17 for details on some 
of these penalties.

Penalties

Late filing. If you don’t file your return 
by the due date (including extensions), 
the penalty is usually 5% of the amount 
due for each month or part of a month 
your return is late, unless you have a 
reasonable explanation. If you have a 
reasonable explanation for filing late, in-

Worksheet in these instructions if any of 
the following applies.

Lines 2a and 2b

General Instructions

Alimony Received

Use Schedule 1 to report income or ad-
justments to income that can’t be en-
tered directly on Form 1040, 1040-SR, 
or 1040-NR.

Line 2a

Enter amounts received as alimony or 
separate maintenance pursuant to a di-
vorce or separation agreement entered 
into on or before December 31, 2018, 
unless that agreement was changed after 
December 31, 2018, to expressly pro-
vide that alimony received isn't included 
in your income. Alimony received is not 
included in your income if you entered 
into a divorce or separation agreement 
after December 31, 2018. If you are in-
cluding alimony in your income, you 
must let the person who made the pay-
ments know your social security num-
ber. If you don’t, you may have to pay a 
penalty. For more details, see Pub. 504.

Additional income is entered on 
Schedule 1, Part I. The amount on 
line 10 of Schedule 1 is entered on Form 
1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 8.

1. You received a refund in 2023 
that is for a tax year other than 2022.

an income tax refund, such as a general 
sales tax or real property tax refund, in 
2023 of an amount deducted or credit 
claimed in an earlier year.

3. You had taxable income on your 
2022 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 15, 
but no tax on your Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, line 16, because of the 0% tax 
rate on net capital gain and qualified 
dividends in certain situations.

Additional Income

Line 1

If you are including alimony pay-
ments from more than one divorce or 
separation agreement in your income, 
enter the total of all alimony received on 
line 2a.

Taxable Refunds, Credits, or 
Offsets of State and Local 
Income Taxes

4. Your 2022 state and local income 
tax refund is more than your 2022 state 
and local income tax deduction minus 
the amount you could have deducted as 
your 2022 state and local general sales 
taxes.

None of your refund is taxable 
if, in the year you paid the tax, 
you either (a) didn't itemize de-
ductions, or (b) elected to deduct state 
and local general sales taxes instead of 
state and local income taxes.

Line 2b

TIP

On line 2b, enter the month and year of 
your original divorce or separation 
agreement that relates to the alimony 
payment, if any, reported on line 2a.

2022 estimated state or local income tax 
in 2023.

tax in 2022.

If you have alimony payments from

agreement, on line 2b enter the month 
and year of the divorce or separation 
agreement for which you received the 
most income. Attach a statement listing 
the month and year of the other agree-
ments.

If you received a refund, credit, or 
offset of state or local income taxes in 
2023, you may be required to report this 
amount. If you didn't receive a Form 
1099-G, check with the government 
agency that made the payments to you. 
Your 2023 Form 1099-G may have been 
made available to you only in an elec-
tronic format, and you will need to get 
instructions from the agency to retrieve 
this document. Report any taxable re-
fund you received even if you didn't re-
ceive Form 1099-G.

7. You couldn't use the full amount 
of credits you were entitled to in 2022 
because the total credits were more than 
the amount shown on your 2022 Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, line 16.

8. You could be claimed as a de-
pendent by someone else in 2022.

Distributions from these accounts may 
be taxable if (a) in the case of distribu-
tions from a QTP, they are more than the 
qualified higher education expenses of 
the designated beneficiary in 2023 or, in 
the case of distributions from an ESA, 
they are more than the qualified educa-
tion expenses of the designated benefi-
ciary in 2023; and (b) they were not in-
cluded in a qualified rollover. Nontaxa-
ble distributions from these accounts 
don’t have to be reported on Form 1040

you can deduct on line 11 up to $300 of 
qualified expenses you paid in 2023. If 
you and your spouse are filing jointly 
and both of you were eligible educators, 
the maximum deduction is $600. How-
ever, neither spouse can deduct more 
than $300 of their qualified expenses on

But if you were also eligible to par-
ticipate in any subsidized health plan 
maintained by your or your spouse's em-
ployer for any month or part of a month 
in 2023, amounts paid for health insur-
ance coverage for that month can't be 
used to figure the deduction. Also, if 
you were eligible for any month or part 
of a month to participate in any subsi-
dized health plan maintained by the em-
ployer of either your dependent or your 
child who was under age 27 at the end

CAUTION
!

• You had more than one source of 
income subject to self-employment tax.

• You file Form 2555.
• You are using amounts paid for 
qualified long-term care insurance to 
figure the deduction.

Example. If you were eligible to par-
ticipate in a subsidized health plan main-
tained by your spouse's employer from 
September 30 through December 31, 
you can't use amounts paid for health in-
surance coverage for September through 
December to figure your deduction.

Use Pub. 974 instead of the work-
sheet in these instructions if the insur-
ance plan was considered to be estab-
lished under your business and was ob-
tained through the Marketplace, and ad-
vance payments of the premium tax 
credit were made or you are claiming 
the premium tax credit.

Medicare premiums you voluntarily 
pay to obtain insurance in your name 
that is similar to qualifying private 
health insurance can be used to figure 
the deduction. Amounts paid for health 
insurance coverage from retirement plan 
distributions that were nontaxable be-
cause you are a retired public safety offi-
cer can't be used to figure the deduction.

If you made contributions to a tradi-
tional IRA for 2023, you may be able to 
take an IRA deduction. But you, or your 
spouse if filing a joint return, must have 
had earned income to do so. For IRA 
purposes, earned income includes alimo-
ny and separate maintenance payments 
reported on Schedule 1, line 2a. If you 
were a member of the U.S. Armed 
Forces, earned income includes any non-
taxable combat pay you received. If you 
were self-employed, earned income is 
generally 
your 
net 
earnings 
from 
self-employment if your personal serv-
ices were a material income-producing 
factor. For more details, see Pub. 590-A. 
A statement should be sent to you by 
May 31, 2024, that shows all contribu-
tions to your traditional IRA for 2023.

4. If you made contributions to your 
IRA in 2023 that you deducted for 2022, 
don’t include them in the worksheet.

Were You Covered by a Retirement 
Plan? 
If you were covered by a retirement plan 
(qualified pension, profit-sharing (in-
cluding 401(k)), annuity, SEP, SIMPLE, 
etc.) at work or through self-employ-
ment, your IRA deduction may be re-
duced or eliminated. But you can still 
make contributions to an IRA even if 
you can't deduct them. In any case, the 
income earned on your IRA contribu-
tions isn't taxed until it is paid to you.

5. If you received income from a 
nonqualified 
deferred 
compensation 
plan or nongovernmental section 457 
plan that is included in box 1 of your 
Form W-2, or in box 1 of Form 
1099-NEC, don’t include that income on 
line 8 of the worksheet. The income 
should be shown in (a) box 11 of your 
Form W-2, (b) box 12 of your Form 
W-2 with code Z, or (c) box 15 of Form 
1099-MISC. If it isn't, contact your em-
ployer or the payer for the amount of the 
income.

The “Retirement plan” box in box 13 
of your Form W-2 should be checked if 
you were covered by a plan at work 
even if you weren’t vested in the plan. 
You are also covered by a plan if you 
were self-employed and had a SEP, 
SIMPLE, or qualified retirement plan.

6. You must file a joint return to de-
duct contributions to your spouse's IRA. 
Enter the total IRA deduction for you 
and your spouse on line 20.

Use the IRA Deduction Worksheet to 
figure the amount, if any, of your IRA 
deduction. But read the following list 
before you fill in the worksheet.

If you were covered by a retirement 
plan and you file Form 2555 or 8815, or 
you exclude employer-provided adop-
tion benefits, see Pub. 590-A to figure 
the amount, if any, of your IRA deduc-
tion.

7. Don’t include rollover contribu-
tions in figuring your deduction. Instead, 
see the instructions for Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, lines 4a and 4b.

1. You can't deduct contributions to 
a Roth IRA. But you may be able to take 
the retirement savings contributions 
credit (saver's credit). See the instruc-
tions for Schedule 3, line 4.

8. Don't include trustees' fees that 
were billed separately and paid by you 
for your IRA.

Married persons filing separately. If 
you weren’t covered by a retirement 
plan but your spouse was, you are con-
sidered covered by a plan unless you 
lived apart from your spouse for all of 
2023.

9. Don’t include any repayments of 
qualified reservist distributions. You 
can't deduct them. For information on 
how to report these repayments, see 
Qualified reservist repayments in Pub. 
590-A.

2. If you are filing a joint return and 
you or your spouse made contributions 
to both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA 
for 2023, don’t use the IRA Deduction 
Worksheet in these instructions. Instead, 
see Pub. 590-A to figure the amount, if 
any, of your IRA deduction.

You may be able to take the re-
tirement savings contributions 
credit. See the Schedule 3, 
line 4, instructions.

TIP

10. If the total of your IRA deduction 
on line 20 plus any nondeductible con-
tribution to your traditional IRAs shown 
on Form 8606 is less than your total tra-
ditional IRA contributions for 2023, see 
Pub. 590-A for special rules.

3. You can’t deduct elective defer-
rals to a 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, sec-
tion 457 plan, SIMPLE plan, or the fed-
eral Thrift Savings Plan. These amounts 
aren't included as income in box 1 of

Disclosure, Privacy Act, and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice

to hear from you. You can send us com-
ments through IRS.gov/FormsComments. 
Or you can send your comments to Inter-
nal Revenue Service, Tax Forms and Pub-
lications Division, 1111 Constitution Ave. 
NW, IR-6526, Washington, DC 20224. 
Don’t send your return to this address. In-
stead, see the addresses at the end of these 
instructions.

The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 
1998, the Privacy Act of 1974, and the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 require 
that when we ask you for information we 
must first tell you our legal right to ask 
for the information, why we are asking 
for it, and how it will be used. We must 
also tell you what could happen if we do 
not receive it and whether your response 
is voluntary, required to obtain a benefit, 
or mandatory under the law.

tax return. This could make the tax higher 
or delay any refund. Interest may also be 
charged.

Generally, tax returns and return infor-
mation are confidential, as stated in Code 
section 6103. However, Code section 
6103 allows or requires the Internal Reve-
nue Service to disclose or give the infor-
mation shown on your tax return to others 
as described in the Code. For example, 
we may disclose your tax information to 
the Department of Justice to enforce the 
tax laws, both civil and criminal, and to 
cities, states, the District of Columbia, 
and U.S. commonwealths or territories to 
carry out their tax laws. We may disclose 
your tax information to the Department of 
Treasury and contractors for tax adminis-
tration purposes; and to other persons as 
necessary to obtain information needed to 
determine the amount of or to collect the 
tax you owe. We may disclose your tax 
information to the Comptroller General of 
the United States to permit the Comptrol-
ler General to review the Internal Reve-
nue Service. We may disclose your tax in-
formation to committees of Congress; 
federal, state, and local child support 
agencies; and to other federal agencies for 
the purposes of determining entitlement 
for benefits or the eligibility for and the 
repayment of loans. We may also disclose 
this information to other countries under a 
tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to 
enforce federal nontax criminal laws, or 
to federal law enforcement and intelli-
gence agencies to combat terrorism.

Although we can't respond individual-
ly to each comment received, we do ap-
preciate your feedback and will consider 
your comments as we revise our tax 
forms and instructions.

This notice applies to all records and 
other material (in paper or electronic for-
mat) you file with us, including this tax 
return. It also applies to any questions we 
need to ask you so we can complete, cor-
rect, or process your return; figure your 
tax; and collect tax, interest, or penalties.

Estimates of Taxpayer 
Burden

The following table shows burden esti-
mates based on current statutory require-
ments as of November 2023 for taxpayers 
filing a 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR tax 
return. Time spent and out-of-pocket 
costs are presented separately. Time bur-
den is broken out by taxpayer activity, 
with recordkeeping representing the larg-
est component. Out-of-pocket costs in-
clude any expenses incurred by taxpayers 
to prepare and submit their tax returns. 
Examples include tax return preparation 
and submission fees, postage and photo-
copying costs, and tax return preparation 
software costs. While these estimates 
don’t include burden associated with 
post-filing activities, IRS operational data 
indicate that electronically prepared and 
filed returns have fewer arithmetic errors, 
implying lower post-filing burden.

Our legal right to ask for information 
is Internal Revenue Code sections 6001, 
6011, and 6012(a), and their regulations. 
They say that you must file a return or 
statement with us for any tax you are lia-
ble for. Your response is mandatory under 
these sections. Code section 6109 re-
quires you to provide your identifying 
number on the return. This is so we know 
who you are, and can process your return 
and other papers. You must fill in all parts 
of the tax form that apply to you. But you 
do not have to check the boxes for the 
Presidential Election Campaign Fund or 
for the third-party designee. You also do 
not have to provide your daytime phone 
number or email address.

You are not required to provide the in-
formation requested on a form that is sub-
ject to the Paperwork Reduction Act un-
less the form displays a valid OMB con-
trol number. Books or records relating to 
a form or its instructions must be retained 
as long as their contents may become ma-
terial in the administration of any Internal 
Revenue law.

Please keep this notice with your re-
cords. It may help you if we ask you for 
other information. If you have questions 
about the rules for filing and giving infor-
mation, please call or visit any Internal 
Revenue Service office.

Reported time and cost burdens are na-
tional averages and don’t necessarily re-
flect a “typical” case. Most taxpayers ex-
perience lower than average burden, with 
taxpayer burden varying considerably by 
taxpayer type. For instance, the estimated 
average time burden for all taxpayers fil-
ing a Form 1040 or 1040-SR is 13 hours, 
with an average cost of $270 per return. 
This average includes all associated forms 
and schedules, across all tax return prepa-
ration methods and taxpayer activities.

We Welcome Comments on 
Forms

We ask for tax return information to 
carry out the tax laws of the United 
States. We need it to figure and collect the 
right amount of tax.

We try to create forms and instructions 
that can be easily understood. Often this 
is difficult to do because our tax laws are 
very complex. For some people with in-
come mostly from wages, filling in the 
forms is easy. For others who have busi-
nesses, pensions, stocks, rental income, or 
other investments, it is more difficult.

If you do not file a return, do not pro-
vide the information we ask for, or pro-
vide fraudulent information, you may be 
charged penalties and be subject to crimi-
nal prosecution. We may also have to dis-
allow the exemptions, exclusions, credits, 
deductions, or adjustments shown on the 

Within this estimate, there is signifi-
cant variation in taxpayer activity. For ex-
ample, nonbusiness taxpayers are expec-
ted to have an average burden of about 9 
hours and $150, while business taxpayers 
are expected to have an average burden of

these forms simpler, we would be happy

and

tion.

On or before the first Monday in February 
of each year, the President is required by 
law to submit to the Congress a budget 
proposal for the fiscal year that begins the 
following October. The budget plan sets 
forth the President's proposed receipts, 
spending, and the surplus or deficit for 
the federal government. The plan includes 
recommendations for new legislation as 
well as recommendations to change, elim-
inate, and add programs. After receipt of 
the President's proposal, the Congress re-
views the proposal and makes changes. It 
first passes a budget resolution setting its 
own targets for receipts, outlays, and sur-
plus or deficit. Next, individual spending 
and revenue bills that are consistent with 
the goals of the budget resolution are 
enacted.

30, 2022, federal income was $4.897 tril-
lion and outlays were $6.273 trillion, 
leaving a deficit of $1.376 trillion.

Your Rights 
as a Taxpayer


 

The Taxpayer Bill of Rights


1. The Right to Be Informed

6. The Right to Finality

Taxpayers have the right to know the maximum amount of 
time they have to challenge the IRS’s position as well as the 
maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax 
year or collect a tax debt. Taxpayers have the right to know 
when the IRS has fnished an audit. 

Taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to 
comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear 
explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, 
instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. They 
have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax 
accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.

7. The Right to Privacy

2. The Right to Quality Service

Taxpayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, 
examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law 
and be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all 
due process rights, including search and seizure protections, 
and will provide, where applicable, a collection due process 
hearing.

Taxpayers have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and 
professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be 
spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear 
and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and 
to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service.

8. The Right to Conﬁdentiality

3. The Right to Pay No More than the 
Correct Amount of Tax

Taxpayers have the right to expect that any information they 
provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by 
the taxpayer or by law. Taxpayers have the right to expect 
appropriate action will be taken against employees, return 
preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer 
return information.

Taxpayers have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally 
due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS 
apply all tax payments properly.

4. The Right to Challenge the IRS’s Position 
and Be Heard

9. The Right to Retain Representation

Taxpayers have the right to raise objections and provide 
additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or 
proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their 
timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and 
to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their 
position.

Taxpayers have the right to retain an authorized representative 
of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the 
IRS. Taxpayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low 
Income Taxpayer Clinic if they cannot afford representation.

10. The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System

Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider 
facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying 
liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely. 
Taxpayers have the right to receive assistance from the 
Taxpayer Advocate Service if they are experiencing fnancial 
diffculty or if the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly 
and timely through its normal channels. 

5. The Right to Appeal an IRS Decision in an 
Independent Forum

Taxpayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative 
appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and 
have the right to receive a written response regarding the IRS 
Independent Offce of Appeals’ decision. Taxpayers generally 
have the right to take their cases to court.

## Steps to file

Use these steps and resources to make filing your Form 1040 easier.

Even if you don't have to file a tax return, you may want to file. You may get
money back:

  * If you qualify for a [refundable tax credit ](/credits-deductions/individuals/refundable-tax-credits "Refundable tax credits")

  * If your employer withheld more taxes than you owe

If you owe tax, it's important to file and [pay on time](/payments/pay-taxes-
on-time "Pay taxes on time") to avoid penalties and interest.

[Find the latest tax changes](/publications/p17#en_US_2023_publink1000170255

## Ready to file now?

File with an [IRS Free File partner](/filing/irs-free-file-do-your-taxes-for-
free "IRS Free File: Do your taxes for free")

Check if you’re eligible for [IRS Direct File](https://directfile.irs.gov/
"IRS Direct File") and file online directly with IRS for free.

## If you need more time to file

If you need more time, you must [request an extension](/filing/get-an-
extension-to-file-your-tax-return "Get an extension to file your tax return")
by the April filing [deadline](/help/ita/what-is-the-due-date-of-my-federal-
tax-return-or-am-i-eligible-to-request-an-extension "What is the due date of
my federal tax return or am I eligible to request an extension?").

Remember, an extension of time to file is not an extension to pay taxes you
owe. Pay any taxes due by the filing deadline to avoid penalties and interest.

Now, more than ever, you need a reliable, fast, secure, contact-less way to
receive your money. The best and fastest way to get your tax refund is to have
it electronically deposited for free into your financial account. The IRS
program is called direct deposit. You can use it to deposit your refund into
one, two or even three accounts. Even if you don’t have a checking account,
there are other options available for direct deposit. Direct deposit is now
also available for returns filed after their due date.

Eight out of ten taxpayers get their refunds by using direct deposit. It is
simple, safe and secure. This is the same electronic transfer system used to
deposit nearly 98 percent of all Social Security and Veterans Affairs benefits
into millions of accounts.

Combining direct deposit with electronic filing is the fastest way to receive
your refund. There’s no chance of it going uncashed, getting lost, stolen, or
destroyed. The IRS issues more than nine out of ten refunds in less than 21
days. Taxpayers who used direct deposit for their tax refunds also received
their stimulus payments more quickly. You can track your refund using our
[Where’s My Refund?](/wheres-my-refund "Where's My Refund?") tool.

Direct deposit is easy to use. Just select it as your refund method through
your tax software and type in the account number and routing number. Or tell
your tax preparer you want direct deposit. You can even use direct deposit if
you are one of the few people still filing by paper. Be sure to double check
your entry to avoid errors.

![Image of a sample check](/pub/image/check_zoom_2.jpg)

**Don’t have a check available to locate your routing and account number?** A
routing number identifies the location of the bank’s branch where you opened
your account and most banks list their routing numbers on their websites. Your
account number can usually be located by signing into your online banking
account or by calling your bank branch.

If you have a prepaid debit card, you may be able to have your refund
deposited to the card. Many reloadable prepaid cards have account and routing
numbers that you can provide to the IRS. Check with the financial institution
to ensure your card can be used and to obtain the routing number and account
number, which may be different from the card number.

**Mobile apps may be an option.****** Some mobile apps and prepaid debit cards
allow for direct deposit of tax refunds. They must have routing and account
numbers associated with them that can be entered on a tax return. Taxpayers
should check with the mobile app provider or financial institution to confirm
which numbers to use.

**What should you do if your financial institution rejects your direct deposit
refund?** The IRS assumes no responsibility for tax preparer or taxpayer
error. Some financial institutions accept direct deposits for some types of
accounts, but not others. Contact your financial institution to ensure they
will accept your direct deposit and [verify your account and routing
number](/faqs/irs-procedures/refund-inquiries/refund-inquiries-18 "Refund
Inquiries 18").

  * Verify your account and routing numbers with your financial institution and double check the accuracy of the numbers you enter on your return prior to signing and submitting it. You should not request a deposit of your refund into an account that's not in your own name.
  * If the return hasn't already posted to our system, you can ask us to stop the direct deposit. You may call us toll-free at [800-829-1040](tel:800-829-1040), M - F, 7 a.m. - 7 p.m.
  * Generally, if the financial institution recovers the funds and returns them to the IRS, the IRS will send a paper refund check to your last known address on file with the IRS.
  * If you have contacted the financial institution and two weeks have passed with no results, you will need to file [Form 3911, Taxpayer Statement Regarding Refund PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3911.pdf "1022 Form 3911                           \(PDF\)") to initiate a trace. This allows the IRS to contact the bank on your behalf to attempt recovery of your refund. Banks are allowed up to 90 days from the date of the initial trace input to respond to our request for information but it may take up to 120 days for resolution.
  * If funds aren't available or the bank refuses to return the funds, the IRS cannot compel the bank to do so. The case may then become a civil matter between you and the financial institution and/or the owner of the account into which the funds were deposited.

**Don’t have a bank account?** Visit the [FDIC
website](https://www.fdic.gov/about/initiatives/getbanked/index.html "Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation \(FDIC\) GetBanked") or the National Credit
Union Administration using their [Credit Union Locator
Tool](https://mapping.ncua.gov "National Credit Union Administration Credit
Union Locator Tool") for information on where to find a bank or credit union
that can open an account online and how to choose the right account for you.
If you are a Veteran, see the [Veterans Benefits Banking Program
(VBBP)](https://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/banking.asp "Veterans Benefits
Banking Program \(VBBP\)") for access to financial services at participating
banks. You can also ask your preparer if they have other electronic payment
options that they offer.

Direct deposit also saves you money. It costs the nation’s taxpayers more than
$1 for every paper refund check issued, but only a dime for each direct
deposit made.

The federal tax refund is often the largest single check many people receive.
It’s an opportune time to start or add to your savings. You can divide your
refund into two or three additional financial accounts, including your
Individual Retirement Account.

**Splitting your refund is easy.** You can use your tax software to do it
electronically. Or, use IRS’ [Form 8888, Allocation of Refund,](/forms-
pubs/about-form-8888 "About Form 8888, Allocation of Refund \(Including
Savings Bond Purchases\)") if you file a paper return. Just follow the
instructions on the form. If you want the IRS to deposit your refund into just
one account, use the direct deposit line on your tax form.

With split refunds, you have a convenient option for managing your money —
sending some of your refund to an account for immediate use and some for
future savings — teamed with the speed and safety of direct deposit. If you
plan to use all or part of your refund to buy savings bonds, you can buy
[paper I bonds with your IRS tax
refund](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/buy-a-bond/#buying-paper
"Paper I bonds HL") until Jan. 1, 2025. After that date, the IRS will no
longer provide this refund option, but you can buy [electronic I
bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds/ "I bonds —
TreasuryDirect") through the U.S. Treasury’s website,
[TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/log-in/ "TreasuryDirect log-in
HL"). See these [FAQs](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/research-center/faq-irs-
tax-feature/ "TreasuryDirect FAQs HL") for more information.

Your refund should only be deposited directly into a United States bank or
United States bank affiliated accounts that are in your own name, your
spouse’s name or both if it’s a joint account. No more than three electronic
refunds can be deposited into a single financial account or pre-paid debit
card. Taxpayers who exceed the [limit](/refunds/direct-deposit-limits "Direct
deposit limits") will receive an IRS notice and a paper refund.

Whether you file electronically or on paper, direct deposit gives you access
to your refund faster than a paper check.

  * Upload scans, photos, or digital copies of documents as JPGs, PNGs or PDFs

The IRS Whistleblower Office pays monetary awards to eligible individuals
whose information is used by the IRS. The award percentage depends on several
factors, but generally falls between 15 and 30 percent of the proceeds
collected and attributable to the whistleblower's information. Awards can only
be issued once a final determination can be made, and as such, award payments
cannot be made until the taxpayer has exhausted all appeal rights and the
taxpayer no longer can file a claim for refund or otherwise seek to recover
the proceeds from the government.

To effectively promote voluntary compliance and reduce the tax gap by
providing excellent service to whistleblowers, taxpayers, and other
stakeholders.

## Mission

To effectively administer the IRS Whistleblower Program by ensuring:

  * IRS compliance functions receive and consider specific, timely, and credible whistleblower claims that identify non-compliance with tax laws or other laws the IRS is authorized to administer, enforce, or investigate;
  * Whistleblowers receive required notifications timely; and
  * Awards are fairly determined and timely paid.

Back to top

## Submit a whistleblower claim

Individuals must use IRS [Form 211, Application for Award for Original
Information PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f211.pdf "0324 Form 211
\(PDF\)"), and ensure that it contains the following:

  * A description of the alleged tax noncompliance, including a written narrative explaining the issue(s).
  * Information to support the narrative, such as copies of books and records, ledger sheets, receipts, bank records, contracts, emails, and the location of assets.
  * A description of documents or supporting evidence not in the whistleblower's possession or control, and their location.
  * An explanation of how and when the whistleblower became aware of the information that forms the basis of the claim.
  * A complete description of the whistleblower's present or former relationship (if any) to the subject of the claim (for example, family member, acquaintance, client, employee, accountant, lawyer, bookkeeper, customer).
  * The whistleblower's original signature on the declaration under penalty of perjury (a representative cannot sign Form 211 for the whistleblower) and the date of signature.

Individuals must then mail the Form 211 with supporting documentation to:

Internal Revenue Service  
Whistleblower Office – ICE  
1973 N Rulon White Blvd.  
M/S 4110  
Ogden, UT 84404

## **Who is eligible to file a claim for award?**

Any individual, other than an individual described below, is eligible to file
a claim for award and to receive an award under section 7623.

The Whistleblower Office will reject any claim for award filed by an
ineligible whistleblower and will provide written notice of the rejection to
the whistleblower. The following individuals are not eligible to file a claim
for award or receive an award under section 7623:

  * An individual who is an employee of the Department of Treasury or was an employee of the Department of Treasury when the individual obtained the information on which the claim is based;
  * An individual who obtained the information through the individual's official duties as an employee of the federal government, or who is acting within the scope of those official duties as an employee of the federal government;
  * An individual who is or was required by federal law or regulation to disclose the information or who is or was precluded by federal law or regulation from disclosing the information;
  * An individual who obtained or had access to the information based on a contract with the federal government; or
  * An individual who filed a claim for award based on information obtained from an ineligible whistleblower for the purpose of avoiding the rejection of the claim that would have resulted if the claim was filed by the ineligible whistleblower.

Back to top

## What are the rules for getting an award?

Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 7623 provides for awards, in some cases
mandatory, when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) takes action based on a
whistleblower's information. Claims for award that provide specific and
credible information regarding tax underpayments or violations of internal
revenue laws and that lead to proceeds collected may qualify for an award.

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 defined proceeds as penalties, interest,
additions to tax, and additional amounts provided under the internal revenue
laws, as well as any proceeds arising from laws for which the IRS is
authorized to administer, enforce, or investigate. This includes criminal
fines, civil forfeitures, and violations of reporting requirements.

In general, the IRS will pay an award of at least 15 percent, but not more
than 30 percent of the proceeds collected attributable to the information
submitted by the whistleblower. The award percentage decreases for claims
based on information from public sources or if the whistleblower planned and
initiated the actions that led to the noncompliance. Awards will be processed
as either a section 7623(a) or 7623(b) award.

To qualify for the IRC section 7623(b) award program, the information must:

  * Relate to a tax noncompliance matter in which the tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional proceeds in dispute exceed $2,000,000; and
  * Relate to a taxpayer, and for individual taxpayers only, one whose gross income exceeds $200,000 for at least one of the tax years in question.

If a submission does not meet the criteria for IRC section 7623(b)
consideration, the IRS will consider it for the discretionary program under
IRC section 7623(a) of the Code.

## Annual report to Congress

The Secretary of the Treasury reports to Congress each fiscal year on the use

  * [Strategic Operating Plan](/about-irs/irs-inflation-reduction-act-strategic-operating-plan "Strategic Operating Plan")

The Strategic Operating Plan outlines how IRS will deliver transformational
change for taxpayers under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

### Fiscal years 2023-2031

The IRA was signed into law in August 2022, giving the IRS a historic
opportunity to transform tax administration and services provided to taxpayers
and tax professionals. The funding provided by IRA will improve how IRS serves
the public and tax professionals. The long-term funding will enable IRS to
update technology capabilities and invest in our employees with new tools,
skills and capabilities, and to effectively enforce the tax laws.

Shortly after IRA’s enactment, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS
developed a Strategic Operating Plan.

Changes to your personal information will affect your tax returns. You must
update your information to prevent delays in processing your tax returns and
refunds.

## How to change your address

If your address has changed, you need to notify the IRS to ensure you receive
any IRS refunds or correspondence. ****

For more information see, [Change Your Address – How to Notify the
IRS](/taxtopics/tc157 "Topic no. 157, Change your address – How to notify the
IRS").

## Update your name

A name change can have an impact on your taxes and delay your refund. All the
names on a taxpayer's tax return must match Social Security Administration
records.

Find out how to update your name, see [A name change affects a tax
return](/newsroom/a-name-change-affects-a-tax-return "A name change affects a
tax return").

## Third-party authorization

You can grant a third-party authorization to help you with federal tax
matters. The third party can be a family member or friend, a tax professional,
attorney or business, depending on the authorization.

Learn how to give authorization to another person, see [Power of Attorney and
Other Authorizations](/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/power-of-
attorney-and-other-authorizations "Power of attorney and other
authorizations").

## Calendar year filers (most common)

**File on:** April 15, 2024

## Fiscal year filers

**File on:** The fourth month after your fiscal year ends, day 15.

If day 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the due date is
delayed until the next business day. Your return is considered filed on time
if your envelope is properly addressed, postmarked and deposited in the mail
by the due date.

See [Publication 509, Tax Calendars](/forms-pubs/about-publication-509 "About
Publication 509, Tax Calendars") for information on:

  * tax filing deadlines
  * filing, paying and other tax action due dates

## Need more time?

If you can't file by the due date of your return, you can request an automatic
6-month extension of time to file. Please be aware that:

  * An extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay.
  * You must file [Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return](/filing/get-an-extension-to-file-your-tax-return "Get an extension to file your tax return") by the original due date of your return.
  * You should pay any owed taxes by your original due date to avoid possible penalties.

## Haven't filed your tax return lately?

If you haven't filed your federal income tax return for this year or for prior
years, you should file your return as soon as possible. See [what to do if you
haven't filed your tax return](/businesses/small-businesses-self-
employed/filing-past-due-tax-returns "Filing past due tax returns").

## Members of the military

[Special rules ](/newsroom/extension-of-deadlines-combat-zone-service
"Extension of Deadlines — Combat Zone Service")may apply if you served or are
serving in the Armed Forces in a combat zone or a contingency operation or
become hospitalized from an injury while serving.

You have at least 180 days after you leave the designated combat
zone/contingency operation to file and pay taxes.

If the Service determines that you're affected by a presidentially declared
disaster or a terroristic or military action, you may have up to one year
after the due date of your return to file and pay taxes, depending on the
deadline specified by the Service.

Taxpayers, including civilians working with the Department of Defense, [must
notify the IRS directly](/newsroom/notifying-the-irs-by-email-about-combat-
zone-service "Notifying the IRS by Email about Combat Zone Service") of their
status for qualifying combat zone relief. For more information, see [Notifying
the IRS by Email about Combat Zone Service](/newsroom/notifying-the-irs-by-
email-about-combat-zone-service "Notifying the IRS by Email about Combat Zone
Service").

Enacted in 1966, the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, gives any person the
right to access federal agency records or information. The FOIA is based on
the presumption that the government and its information belong to the people.

A 1996 amendment to the FOIA, required federal agencies to make many types of
records available online. Visit the [IRS FOIA Library](/privacy-
disclosure/foia-library "FOIA Library") to learn more.

New law, like the [Open Government
Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-110publ81 "Public Law 110 - 81 -
Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007"), as well as new policies,
such as those issued by the President and the Attorney General, promote the
spirit of transparency envisioned by our founding fathers.

#### Routine access to IRS records

The IRS offers [routine access to other records](/privacy-disclosure/routine-
access-to-irs-records "Routine access to IRS records") through procedures
designed to make access quick and easy. For more information, use the Routine
Access link at the right. If you are working directly with an IRS employee on
an open tax case, you can request information from the file directly from
them.

#### Formal requests

To assist FOIA requesters each IRS Disclosure Office serves as a FOIA
Requester Service Center. The IRS FOIA guide describes the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) in general and gives specific instructions for making a
FOIA request, including a sample letter, an explanation of potential fees and
where to file requests.

[IRS FOIA guide](/privacy-disclosure/freedom-of-information-act-foia-
guidelines "Freedom of Information Act \(FOIA\) guidelines")

#### FOIA public liaison

FOIA requestors who have questions on a submitted request or want to know the
status of a request may contact the IRS FOIA Public Liaison line at
[312-292-2929](tel:312-292-2929).

If you have general questions on the IRS FOIA process, review the IRS FOIA
Guidelines page before submitting a request.

## How refunds work

If you paid more through the year than you owe in tax, you may get money back.
Even if you didn't pay tax, you may still get a refund if you qualify for a
[refundable credit](/credits-deductions/individuals/refundable-tax-credits
"Refundable tax credits"). To get your refund, you must [file a
return](/filing/individuals/how-to-file "File your return"). You have [3 years
to claim a tax refund](/filing/time-you-can-claim-a-credit-or-refund "Time you
can claim a credit or refund").

Refund: Claim it or lose it
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GwcfEESr4g "Refund: Claim It or Lose
It - YouTube video"), 2:05).

## Check your refund

If you e-file your return, you can usually see your refund status after about
48 hours with Where's My Refund? You can get your refund information for the
current year and past 2 years.

[Check your refund](/wheres-my-refund "Where's My Refund?")

## Check your refund on an amended return

Amended returns take up to 3 weeks to show up in our system and up to 16 weeks
to process. To check on an amended return, visit [Where's My Amended
Return?](/filing/wheres-my-amended-return "Where’s My Amended Return?")

## When to expect your refund

To process your refund, it usually takes:

  * Up to 21 days for an e-filed return

  * 4 weeks or more for amended returns and returns sent by mail

  * Longer if your return needs corrections or extra review

The timing of your refund may change if you:

  * [Claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit](/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/when-to-expect-your-refund-if-you-claimed-the-earned-income-tax-credit-or-additional-child-tax-credit "When to expect your refund if you claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit")
  * [File a paper return](/wheres-my-refund "Where's My Refund?")
  * [File an amended return](/filing/file-an-amended-return "File an amended return")
  * [Request injured spouse relief](/individuals/injured-spouse-relief "Injured spouse relief")
  * [File a Form 1040-NR, Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-nr "About Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return") (can take up to 6 months)
  * [Make an error on your return](/taxtopics/tc303 "Topic no. 303, Checklist of common errors when preparing your tax return")
  * [File with an individual taxpayer ID number](/individuals/itin-expiration-faqs "ITIN expiration FAQs")
  * [Have a refund over $2 million](/refunds/large-tax-refunds-and-credits-subject-to-review-by-the-joint-committee-on-taxation-what-to-expect "Large tax refunds and credits subject to review by the Joint Committee on Taxation – What to expect")

## Choose how to get your refund

You can get your refund by:

**Direct deposit** : This is the fastest way to get your refund. Deposit into
your checking, savings, or retirement account. You can [split your
refund](/refunds/frequently-asked-questions-about-splitting-federal-income-
tax-refunds "Frequently asked questions about splitting federal income tax
refunds") into up to 3 accounts. (Watch Direct deposit your refund
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mfpKTx-5nE "Direct Deposit for Your
Tax Refund - YouTube video"), 1:00).

**Paper check** : We'll mail your check to the address on your return. [Notify
us if you changed your address](/faqs/irs-procedures/address-changes "Address
changes").

**Prepaid debit card** : Check with your bank or card provider to see if your
card will work and which account numbers to use.

**Mobile payment apps** : Some apps accept direct deposits.

**Traditional, Roth or SEP-IRA:** [Deposit into your existing IRA
account](/instructions/i1040gi "1040 \(2023\) ").

## Plan next year's refund

To get a bigger or smaller refund next filing season, adjust the taxes you pay
through the year with the [Tax Withholding Estimator](/individuals/tax-
withholding-estimator "Tax Withholding Estimator").

## Solve a refund problem

**If your refund isn't what you expected** , it may be because:

  * We corrected mistakes on your return. You'll get a notice explaining the changes. Details are also in [Where's My Refund?](/wheres-my-refund "Where's My Refund?")
  * Your refund was used to pay your IRS tax balance or [certain state or federal debts](/taxtopics/tc203 "Topic no. 203, Reduced refund").
  * Your refund from a joint return was [applied to your spouse's debts](/taxtopics/tc203 "Topic no. 203, Reduced refund").

**If your refund is missing or destroyed** , [request a replacement
check](/faqs/irs-procedures/refund-inquiries/refund-inquiries-0 "Refund
Inquiries ").

**If you entered the wrong account or routing number** , call us at
[800-829-1040](tel:800-829-1040) to stop the deposit. If it's already
deposited to another account, you must contact your bank to recover your
funds.

**If you got a paper check instead of direct deposit** , it’s because:

  * The account is not under your name, your spouse's name or a joint account
  * Your financial institution rejected a direct deposit
  * You requested more than 3 electronic refunds into 1 account

**If you get a refund you're not entitled to** , [promptly return it to
us](/taxtopics/tc161 "Topic no. 161, Returning an erroneous refund – Paper
check or direct deposit").

## Phone help

[Where's My Refund](/wheres-my-refund "Where's My Refund?") has the latest
information on your return. If you don't have internet, call the automated
refund hotline at [800-829-1954](tel:800-829-1954) for a current-year refund
or [866-464-2050](tel:866-464-2050) for an amended return.

For prior-year refunds, check [Where’s My Refund](/wheres-my-refund "Where's
My Refund?"). We can’t give you the refund status over the phone.

If you think we made a mistake with your refund, check [Where's My
Refund](/wheres-my-refund "Where's My Refund?") or your [online
account](/payments/online-account-for-individuals "Online account for
individuals") for details.

## IRS wants you to know about schemes, scams and cons

"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!" Don't become a victim to
any scheme that offers instant wealth or exemption from your obligation as a
United States citizen to file tax returns and/or pay taxes. Some of these
schemes can literally cost you your life savings. Others can result in your
prosecution and imprisonment if you knowingly participate in them.

## Abusive return preparer

Taxpayers should be very careful when choosing a tax preparer. While most
preparers provide excellent service to their clients, a few unscrupulous
return preparers file false and fraudulent tax returns and ultimately defraud
their clients. It is important to know that even if someone else prepares your
return, you are ultimately responsible for all the information on the tax
return.

## Abusive tax schemes

Abusive tax scheme originally took the structure of fraudulent domestic and
foreign trust arrangements. However, these schemes have evolved into
sophisticated arrangements to give the appearance that taxpayers are not in
control of their money. However, the taxpayers receive their funds through
debit/credit cards or fictitious loans. These schemes often involve offshore
banking and sometimes establish scam corporations or entities.

## Non-filer enforcement

There have always been individuals who, for a variety of reasons, argue taxes
are voluntary or illegal. The courts have repeatedly rejected their arguments
as frivolous and routinely impose financial penalties for raising such
frivolous arguments. Take the time to learn the truth about frivolous tax
arguments.

## [Tax scams - How to report them](/help/tax-scams/report-a-tax-scam-or-fraud
"Report a tax scam or fraud")

To help the public recognize and avoid abusive tax schemes, the IRS offers an
abundance of educational materials. Participating in an illegal scheme to
avoid paying taxes can result in imprisonment and fines, as well as the
repayment of taxes owed with penalties and interest. Education is the best way
to avoid the pitfalls of these “too good to be true” tax scams.

If you find a mistake after filing your taxes, you may need to amend your
return. To see if you should file an amended return: answer these questions on
the [Should I file an amended return?](/help/ita/should-i-file-an-amended-
return "Should I file an amended return?") page.

## Check on an amended return

[Check the status of an amended return](/filing/wheres-my-amended-return
"Where’s My Amended Return?")

## Reasons to amend a return

File an amended return if there's a change in your:

  * Filing status
  * Income
  * Deductions
  * Credits
  * Dependents
  * Tax liability

You don't need to amend your return if we:

  * Let you know that we corrected errors on your return.
  * Accept your return without certain forms or schedules or ask you to send them.

## When to file an amended return

Generally, to claim a refund, you must file an amended return within 3 years
after the date you filed your original return or 2 years after the date you
paid the tax, whichever is later. If you filed early, count from the April tax
deadline.

[Special rules apply to file for refunds](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040x "About
Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return") when you have net
operating losses, foreign tax credits, bad debts, and other issues.

You may have more time to amend for:

  * A federally declared disaster
  * Service in a combat zone or contingency operation
  * A bad debt or worthless security
  * A foreign tax credit or deduction
  * A loss or credit carryback

Find details on [when to file an amended return](/instructions/i1040x
"Instructions for Form 1040-X \(09/2024\) ")

## How to file an amended return

To amend a return, file [Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax
Return](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040x "About Form 1040-X, Amended U.S.
Individual Income Tax Return"). You can use tax software to electronically
file your 1040-X online.

Submit all the same forms and schedules as you did when you filed your
original Form 1040 even if you don't have adjustments on them.

File [Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization](/forms-pubs/about-
form-8879 "About Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization") with your
1040-X.

You can file up to 3 amended returns for the same year.

[File on paper](/instructions/i1040x "Instructions for Form 1040-X \(09/2024\)
") if you're amending a return:

  * You filed on paper this year
  * For tax years before 2021

## Get your refund on your amended return

If you amend a return for tax years 2021 and later, you can request your
refund by direct deposit. Enter your bank account information on the
electronically filed Form 1040-X or corrected Form 1040-SS/PR. If you
submitted a paper version of Form 1040-X, you'll receive a paper check.

You can also attach [Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond
Purchases) PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8888.pdf "1122 Form 8888
\(PDF\)") to deposit your refund to multiple bank accounts. You can't use
refunds from amended returns to buy savings bonds.

## If you owe tax

Mail a check or money order payable to United States Treasury with [Form
1040-V, Payment Voucher PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040v.pdf "2024
Form 1040-V                         \(PDF\)"). If you owe additional tax, file
your amended return, and pay the tax by the April due date to avoid penalties
and interest. Your return will replace your original return. If you file after
the April due date, don't include any interest or penalties on your amended
return. We'll make any needed adjustments automatically.

## State tax returns

If you change your federal return, it may affect your state tax liability. For
information on how to correct your state tax return, contact your [state tax
agency](/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/state-government-websites
"State government websites").**** Don't attach your state tax return to your
amended return.

Use this tool to estimate the federal income tax you want your employer to
withhold from your paycheck. This is [tax withholding](/payments/tax-
withholding "Tax withholding").

See how your withholding affects your refund, take-home pay or tax due.  

## How it works

Use this tool to:

  * Estimate your federal income tax withholding
  * See how your refund, take-home pay or tax due are affected by withholding amount
  * Choose an estimated withholding amount that works for you

Results are as accurate as the information you enter.

## What you need

Have this ready:

  * ﻿Paystubs for all jobs (spouse too)
  * Other income info (side jobs, self-employment, investments, etc.)
  * Most recent tax return

Your information isn't saved. Learn more [about
Security](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator#security
"Tax Withholding Estimator Security").

[Use the Tax Withholding Estimator](https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-
estimator "Tax Withholding Estimator")

## Don't use this tool if:

  * **You have nonresident alien status.** Use Notice 1392, Supplemental Form W-4 Instructions for Nonresident Aliens.
  * **Your tax situation is complex.** This includes alternative minimum tax. See Publication 505, [Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax](/forms-pubs/about-publication-505 "About Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax").

* * *

## After you use the estimator

Use your estimate to change your tax withholding amount on Form W-4. Or keep
the same amount.

### To change your tax withholding amount:

  * Enter your new tax withholding amount on [Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-4 "About Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate")
  * Ask your employer if they use an automated system to submit Form W-4
  * Submit or give Form W-4 to your employer

### To keep your same tax withholding amount:

  * You don't need to do anything at this time.
  * Check your withholding again when needed and each year with the Estimator. This helps you make sure the amount withheld works for your circumstance.  

## When to check your withholding

Check your tax withholding every year, especially:

### When you have a major life change

  * New job or other paid work
  * Major income change
  * Marriage
  * Child birth or adoption
  * Home purchase

### If you changed your tax withholding mid-year

  * Check your tax withholding at year-end, and adjust as needed with a new W-4

If you have more questions about your withholding, ask your employer or tax
advisor.

## Why check your withholding

There are several reasons to check your withholding:

  * It can protect against having too little tax withheld and facing an unexpected tax bill or penalty at tax time next year.
  * It can let you adjust your tax withheld up front, so you receive a bigger paycheck and smaller refund at tax time.

## Security

The Tax Withholding Estimator doesn't ask for personal information such as
your name, social security number, address or bank account numbers.

We don't save or record the information you enter in the estimator.

Alerts](/help/tax-scams/recognize-tax-scams-and-fraud "Recognize tax scams and
fraud").

## Pandemic-related penalty relief

We’re issuing automatic relief for failure to pay penalties for certain 2020
or 2021 returns with assessed tax less than $100,000. This relief is to help
taxpayers who didn’t get reminder notices during the pandemic-related pause in
mailing IRS collection notices.

Find details in the [December 19, 2023, news release](/newsroom/irs-helps-
taxpayers-by-providing-penalty-relief-on-nearly-5-million-2020-and-2021-tax-
returns-restart-of-collection-notices-in-2024-marks-end-of-pandemic-related-
pause "IRS helps taxpayers by providing penalty relief on nearly 5 million
2020 and 2021 tax returns; restart of collection notices in 2024 marks end of
pandemic-related pause") and [Notice 2024-7 PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-
drop/n-24-07.pdf "N-2024-07").

Taxpayers who don’t meet their tax obligations may owe a penalty.

The IRS charges a penalty for various reasons, including if you don’t:

  * File your tax return on time
  * Pay any tax you owe on time and in the right way
  * Prepare an accurate return
  * Provide accurate and timely filed information returns

We may charge interest on a penalty if you don’t pay it in full. We charge
some penalties every month until you pay the full amount you owe.

Understand the different types of penalties, what you need to do if you get a
penalty and how to avoid getting one.

## How you know you owe a penalty

When we charge you a penalty, we send you a notice or letter by mail. The
notice or letter will tell you about the penalty, the reason for the charge
and what to do next. These notices and letters include an identification
number.

Verify the information in your notice or letter is correct. If you can resolve
the issue in your notice or letter, a penalty may not apply.

For more information, see [Understanding your notice or
letter](/individuals/understanding-your-irs-notice-or-letter "Understanding
your IRS notice or letter").

## Types of penalties

These are some penalties we send notices and letters about:

  * [Information return](/payments/information-return-penalties "Information return penalties") applies to taxpayers who don’t file or furnish their required information return or payee statement correctly by the due date.
  * [Failure to file](/payments/failure-to-file-penalty "Failure to File Penalty") applies when you don’t file your tax return by the due date.
  * [Failure to pay](/payments/failure-to-pay-penalty "Failure to Pay Penalty") applies when you don’t pay the tax you owe by the due date.
  * [Accuracy-related](/payments/accuracy-related-penalty "Accuracy-related penalty") applies when you don’t claim all your income or when you claim deductions or credits for which you don’t qualify.
  * [_Erroneous claim for refund or credit penalty_](/payments/erroneous-claim-for-refund-or-credit "Erroneous claim for refund or credit") applies when you submit a claim for refund or credit of income tax for an excessive amount and reasonable cause does not apply.
  * [Failure to deposit](/payments/failure-to-deposit-penalty "Failure to Deposit Penalty") applies when you don’t pay employment taxes accurately or on time.
  * [Tax preparer penalties](/payments/tax-preparer-penalties "Tax preparer penalties") apply to tax return preparers who engage in misconduct.
  * [Dishonored checks](/payments/dishonored-check-or-other-form-of-payment-penalty "Dishonored check or other form of payment penalty") or other form of payment applies when your bank doesn’t honor your check or other form of payment.
  * [Underpayment of estimated tax by corporations](/payments/underpayment-of-estimated-tax-by-corporations-penalty "Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Corporations penalty") applies when you don’t pay estimated tax accurately or on time for a corporation.
  * [Underpayment of estimated tax by individuals](/payments/underpayment-of-estimated-tax-by-individuals-penalty "Underpayment of estimated tax by individuals penalty") applies when you don’t pay estimated tax accurately or on time as an individual.
  * [International information reporting](/payments/international-information-reporting-penalties "International information reporting penalties") applies to certain taxpayers who fail to timely and correctly report foreign sourced financial activity.

## Interest on a penalty

We charge interest on penalties.

The date from which we begin to charge interest varies by the type of penalty.
Interest increases the amount you owe until you pay your balance in full. For
more information about the interest we charge on penalties, see
[Interest](/payments/interest "Interest").

## Pay a penalty

[Send us a payment or pay your taxes in full](/payments "Payments ") to stop
future penalties and interest from adding up.

## Remove or reduce a penalty

We may be able to remove or reduce some penalties if you acted in good faith
and can show [reasonable cause](/payments/penalty-relief-for-reasonable-cause
"Penalty relief for reasonable cause") for why you weren’t able to meet your
tax obligations. By law we cannot remove or reduce interest unless the penalty
is removed or reduced.

For more information, see [penalty relief](/payments/penalty-relief "Penalty
relief").

## Dispute a penalty

If you disagree with the amount you owe, you may dispute the penalty.

Call us at the toll-free number at the top right corner of your notice or
letter or write us a letter stating why we should reconsider the penalty. Sign
and send your letter along with any supporting documents to the address on
your notice.

Have this information when you call or send your letter:

  * The notice or letter we sent you
  * The penalty you want us to reconsider (for example, a 2021 late filing penalty)
  * For each penalty, an explanation of why you think we should remove it

If a notice or letter we sent you has instructions or deadlines for disputing
the penalty, pay careful attention. You must follow the instructions to
dispute the penalty.

If you didn’t receive a notice or letter, get [telephone
assistance](/help/let-us-help-you "Let us help you").

## Avoid a penalty

You can avoid a penalty by filing accurate returns, paying your tax by the due
date, and furnishing any information returns timely. If you can’t do so, you
can apply for an extension of time to file or a payment plan.

### Apply for an extension of time to file

If you need more time to prepare your tax return, [apply for an extension of
time to file](/filing/get-an-extension-to-file-your-tax-return "Get an
extension to file your tax return"). This does not grant you an extension of
time to pay. A payment plan can help you pay over time.

### Apply for a payment plan

If you can't pay the full amount of your taxes or penalty on time, pay what
you can now and [apply for a payment plan](/payments/online-payment-agreement-
application "Online payment agreement application"). You may reduce future
penalties when you set up a payment plan.

## Limited service: Nov. 9 and 10

We’re making planned updates. This service is unavailable during these times:

  * Nov. 9, 1 a.m.-3 p.m. ET
  * Nov. 10, 1 a.m.-9 p.m. ET

Thank you for your patience.

An identity protection PIN (IP PIN) is a six-digit number that prevents
someone else from filing a tax return using your Social Security number (SSN)
or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). The IP PIN is known only
to you and the IRS. It helps us verify your identity when you file your
electronic or paper tax return. Even though you may not have a filing
requirement, an IP PIN still protects your account.

If you are a confirmed victim of tax-related identity theft and we have
resolved your tax account issues, we’ll mail you a [CP01A
Notice](/individuals/understanding-your-cp01a-notice "Understanding your CP01A
notice") with your new IP PIN each year.

If you don't already have an IP PIN, you may get an IP PIN as a proactive step
to protect yourself from tax-related identity theft. Anyone with an SSN or an
ITIN can get an IP PIN including individuals living abroad.

## How to get an IP PIN

  * The fastest way to receive an IP PIN is to request one through [your Online Account](/payments/online-account-for-individuals "Online account for individuals"). If you don’t already have an account on IRS.gov, you must register to validate your identity.
  * Spouses and dependents are eligible for an IP PIN if they can pass the identity verification process.
  * Once you have opted in and obtained an IP PIN online, you will need to retrieve your IP PIN online each calendar year as a CP01A Notice will not be mailed.
  * The IP PIN is generally available in your online account starting in mid-January through mid-November. Select the button to get started.

[Get an IP PIN](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/icce-
core/loac/ippin/pages/ippin.xhtml)

## Alternatives to online enrollment

If you want an IP PIN but can’t successfully establish an online account,
there are alternatives. Please note using an alternative method to the online
account takes longer for an IP PIN to be assigned to you.

#### Filing an application for an IP PIN

If your adjusted gross income on your last filed return is below $79,000 for
Individuals or $158,000 for married filing joint and you can’t establish an
online account, you have the option to use [Form 15227, Application for an
Identity Protection Personal Identification Number
PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f15227.pdf "0124 Form 15227 \(en-sp\)
\(PDF\)"). You must have:

  * A valid Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number.
  * An adjusted gross income on your last filed return is below $79,000 for Individuals or $158,000 for married filing joint.
  * Access to a telephone

We will use the telephone number provided on the Form 15227 to call you and
validate your identity. Once we verify your identity, you will receive your IP
PIN via the U.S. Postal Service usually within four to six weeks. You will
then receive your IP PIN annually through the mail.

#### Requesting in-person authentication for an IP PIN

If you’re unable to verify your identity online or with the Form 15227 process
or you are ineligible to file Form 15227, you may [make an
appointment](/node/16903) for an in-person meeting at a local Taxpayer
Assistance Center. Please bring one current government-issued picture
identification document and another identification document to prove your
identity. Once we verify your identity, you will receive your IP PIN via the
U.S. Postal Service usually within three weeks. You will then receive your IP
PIN annually through the mail.

## Important information about IP PINs

  * An IP PIN is valid for one calendar year.
  * A new IP PIN is generated each year for your account.
  * Logging back into your online account, will display your current IP PIN.
  * An IP PIN must be used when filing any federal tax returns during the year including prior year returns. 
  * See [FAQs about the identity protection personal identification number (IP PIN)](/identity-theft-fraud-scams/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-identity-protection-personal-identification-number-ip-pin "FAQs about the Identity Protection Personal Identification Number \(IP PIN\)")

## Using an IP PIN to file

Enter the six-digit IP PIN when prompted by your tax software product or
provide it to your trusted tax professional preparing your tax return. The IP
PIN is used only on Forms 1040, 1040-NR, 1040-PR, 1040-SR, and 1040-SS.

**Correct IP PINs must be entered on electronic and paper tax returns to avoid
rejections and delays.** An incorrect or missing IP PIN will result in the
rejection of your e-filed return or a delay of your paper return until it can
be verified.

Don’t reveal your IP PIN to anyone. It should be known only to your tax
professional and only when you are ready to sign and submit your return. **The
IRS will never ask for your IP PIN. Phone calls, emails or texts asking for
your IP PIN are scams.**

## Lost IP PINs

Review [Retrieve your IP PIN](/identity-theft-fraud-scams/retrieve-your-ip-pin
"Retrieve you IP PIN") for details. Do **not** file a Form 15227 to apply for
a new IP PIN.

Use Form 4506-T to request any of the transcripts: tax return, tax account,
wage and income, record of account and verification of non-filling.

The transcript format better protects taxpayer data by partially masking
personally identifiable information. Financial data remains fully visible to
allow for tax preparation, tax representation, or income verification.

Because the taxpayer identification number is masked, there is a field on the
[Form 4506-T PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf "0623 Form 4506-T
\(PDF\)") to enter a customer file number which will display on the
transcript. Learn more at [About tax transcripts](/individuals/about-tax-
transcripts "About tax transcripts").

Use Form W-7 to apply for an IRS individual taxpayer identification number
(ITIN). You can also use this form to renew an existing ITIN that is expiring
or that has already expired.

An ITIN is a 9-digit number issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
to individuals who are required for U.S. federal tax purposes to have a U.S.
taxpayer identification number but who do not have and are not eligible to get
a Social Security number (SSN).

## Hours of operation

Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

## Step 1: Determine your eligibility

  * You may apply for an EIN online if your principal business is located in the United States or U.S. Territories.
  * The person applying online must have a valid Taxpayer Identification Number (SSN, ITIN, EIN).
  * You are limited to one EIN per [responsible party](/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/responsible-parties-and-nominees " Responsible parties and nominees") per day. 
    * The "responsible party" is the person who ultimately owns or controls the entity or who exercises ultimate effective control over the entity. Unless the applicant is a government entity, the responsible party must be an individual (i.e., a natural person), not an entity.

## Step 2: Understand the online application

  * You must complete this application in one session, as you will not be able to save and return at a later time. 
  * Your session will expire after 15 minutes of inactivity, and you will need to start over.

## Step 3: Submit your application

  * After all validations are done you will get your EIN immediately upon completion. You can then download, save, and print your EIN confirmation notice.

online now")

## Employer tax responsibilities explained (Publications 15, 15-A and 15B)

[Publication 15 PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf "2024 Publ 15
\(PDF\)") provides information on employer tax responsibilities related to
taxable wages, employment tax withholding and which tax returns must be filed.
More complex issues are discussed in [Publication 15-A
PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf "2024 Publ 15-A
\(PDF\)") and tax treatment of many employee benefits can be found in
Publication 15. We recommend employers download these publications from
IRS.gov. Copies can be requested online (search "Forms and Publications) or by
calling [800-TAX-FORM](tel:800-829-3676).

## Important

We cannot process your application online if the responsible party is an
entity with an EIN previously obtained through the Internet. Please use one of
our other methods to apply. See [How to apply for an EIN](/businesses/small-
businesses-self-employed/how-to-apply-for-an-ein "How to Apply for an EIN").
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.

## Purpose of an employer identification number

Employer Identification Numbers are issued for the purpose of tax
administration and are not intended for participation in any other activities
(e.g., tax lien auction or sales, lotteries, etc.)

## Exempt organization information

If you believe your organization qualifies for tax exempt status (whether or
not you have a requirement to apply for a formal ruling), be sure your
organization is formed legally before you apply for an EIN. Nearly all
organizations exempt under IRC 501(a) are subject to automatic revocation of
their tax-exempt status if they fail to file a required annual information
return or notice for three consecutive years. When you apply for an EIN, we
presume you're legally formed and the clock starts running on this three-year
period.

**Example:** Your organization applies for an EIN in November 2023 and chooses
a December accounting period. Your first tax period would end on December 31,
2023, and your first return or notice (if your organization does not meet one
of the few exceptions to the annual reporting requirement) would be due May
15, 2024. You would be subject to automatic revocation of your exemption if
you fail to file for the three periods that end December 31, 2025
(return/notice due May 15, 2026) or for any consecutive three-year period
thereafter.

## Reporting of beneficial ownership information

You may be required to report certain information on your beneficial owners to
the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN). Certain types of corporations, limited liability companies, and
other similar entities created in or registered to do business in the United
States must report information about their beneficial owners—the persons who
ultimately own or control the company, to FinCEN **beginning on January 1,
2024**. If you are a company required to report, the initial beneficial
ownership information reporting is based on the date your company receives
actual notice that its creation or registration is effective, or after a
secretary of state or similar office first provides public notice of its
creation or registration, whichever is earlier.

Questions such as will my company be required to report beneficial ownership
information to FinCEN, who is a beneficial owner, and when do I need to report
my company's beneficial ownership information are found on
[FinCEN's](https://www.fincen.gov/ "FinCEN website") website.

IR-2024-286, Nov. 7, 2024

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today released financial information
and highlighted selected accomplishments and challenges in its fiscal year
2024 [Financial Report PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5456.pdf "1124
Publ 5456                           \(PDF\)").

During fiscal year 2024, the IRS collected more than $5.1 trillion in tax
revenue, collected more than $98 billion in enforcement revenue and
distributed $553 billion in federal tax refunds and other outlays. This year’s
[report presents the IRS’s current financial position
PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5456.pdf "1124 Publ 5456
\(PDF\)") and discusses key financial topics. It highlights the programs,
accomplishments, challenges and management's accountability for the resources
entrusted to the IRS.

The IRS received an unmodified (clean) opinion on its financial statements for
the 25th consecutive year from the Government Accountability Office. GAO also
provided an unmodified opinion on the overall effectiveness of the IRS’s
internal controls over financial reporting. An unmodified opinion means the
financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The IRS reached a major milestone in fiscal year 2024 by resolving a
longstanding significant deficiency in information system controls after 11
years. This change reflects the IRS making substantial improvements and
strengthening information technology internal controls.

The Agency Financial Report is prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Office of Management and Budget Circular A-136, Financial Reporting
Requirements.

Earlier this year, the IRS [received its second consecutive Certificate of
Excellence in Accountability Reporting (CEAR) award](/newsroom/irs-wins-
certificate-of-excellence-in-accountability-report-award-for-second-year-
running "IRS wins Certificate of Excellence in Accountability Report award for
second year running"). This prestigious award, presented by AGA, an
association that connects and empowers financial-related professionals who
support government, is for the IRS’s [FY 2023 Agency Financial Report](/about-
irs/irs-financial-reports "IRS financial reports"). The award is the highest
form of recognition in federal government financial management and performance
accountability reporting.

The IRS also received a second coveted CEAR award recognizing the organization
as "Best in Class" for excellent overall presentation of the Management's
Discussion and Analysis section for its FY 2023 report.

## Guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin

The Internal Revenue Bulletin (Bulletin) is the authoritative instrument of
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing official rulings and
procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and for publishing treasury
decisions, executive orders, tax conventions, legislation, court decisions,
and other items of general interest.

It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive
rulings necessary to promote a uniform application of the tax laws, including
all rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those previously
published in the Bulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless
otherwise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internal
management are not published; however, statements of internal practices and
procedures that affect the rights and duties of taxpayers are published.

Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of
the law to the pivotal facts stated in the revenue ruling. In those based on
positions taken in rulings to taxpayers or technical advice to Service field
offices, identifying details and information of a confidential nature are
deleted to prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with
statutory requirements.

Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and
effect of Treasury Department regulations, but they may be used as precedents.
Rulings not published in the Bulletin will not be relied on, used, or cited as
precedents by Service personnel in the disposition of other cases. In applying
published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation,
regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered, and
Service personnel and others concerned are cautioned against reaching the same
conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are
substantially the same.

## FAQs

FAQs are a valuable alternative to guidance published in the Bulletin because
they allow the IRS to more quickly communicate information to the public on
topics of frequent inquiry and general applicability. FAQs typically provide
responses to general inquiries rather than applying the law to taxpayer-
specific facts and may not reflect various special rules or exceptions that
could apply in any particular case. FAQs that have not been published in the
Bulletin will not be relied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service
personnel in the disposition of cases. Similarly, if an FAQ turns out to be an
inaccurate statement of the law as applied to a particular taxpayer’s case,
the law will control the taxpayer’s tax liability. Only guidance that is
published in the Bulletin has precedential value.

Notwithstanding the non-precedential nature of FAQs, a taxpayer’s reasonable
reliance on an FAQ (even one that is subsequently updated or modified) is
relevant and will be considered in determining whether certain penalties
apply. Taxpayers who show that they relied in good faith on an FAQ and that
their reliance was reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances will
not be subject to a penalty that provides a reasonable cause standard for
relief, including a negligence penalty or other accuracy-related penalty, to
the extent that reliance results in an underpayment of tax. See [Treas. Reg. §
1.6664-4(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-
idx?SID=1b2b14f0922063e6b00b93d0237127a1&mc=true&node=se26.15.1_16664_64&rgn=div8
"Treas. Reg. § 1.6664-4\(b\)") for more information. In addition, FAQs that
are published in a Fact Sheet that is linked to an IRS news release are
considered authority for purposes of the exception to accuracy-related
penalties that applies when there is substantial authority for the treatment
of an item on a return. See [Treas. Reg. §
1.6662-4(d)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-
idx?SID=1b2b14f0922063e6b00b93d0237127a1&mc=true&node=se26.15.1_16662_64&rgn=div8
"Treas. Reg. § 1.6662-4\(d\) ") for more information.

## Informal guidance (forms, instructions, publications, IRS.gov webpages)

Informal guidance like forms, instructions, publications and IRS.gov webpages
is another valuable alternative to guidance published in the Bulletin. This
informal guidance allows the IRS to more quickly provide administrative,
educational, and procedural information to taxpayers needing information
quickly, such as how and where to file returns, what to do if financial
records are lost in a major disaster and other information about forms and
instructions. Similar to FAQs, informal guidance does not apply the law to
taxpayer-specific facts and may not reflect various special rules or
exceptions that could apply in any particular case. Informal guidance has not
been published in the Bulletin and will not be relied on, used, or cited as
precedents by Service personnel in the disposition of cases. If information
included in informal guidance turns out to be an inaccurate statement of the
law as applied to a particular taxpayer's case, the law will control the
taxpayer's tax liability. Only guidance that is published in the Bulletin has
precedential value.

Notwithstanding the non-precedential nature of informal guidance like forms
instructions, publications and IRS.gov webpages, a taxpayer's reasonable
reliance on that informal guidance (even if the informal guidance is
subsequently updated or modified) is relevant and will be considered in
determining whether certain penalties apply. Taxpayers who show that they
relied in good faith on informal guidance and that their reliance was
reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances will not be subject to a
penalty that provides a reasonable cause standard for relief, including a
negligence penalty or other accuracy-related penalty, to the extent that
reliance results in an underpayment of tax. See [Treas. Reg. §
1.6664-4(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-
idx?SID=1b2b14f0922063e6b00b93d0237127a1&mc=true&node=se26.15.1_16664_64&rgn=div8

The Department of Treasury's [Bureau of the Fiscal Service
(BFS)](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/ "Bureau of the Fiscal Service") issues
IRS tax refunds and Congress authorizes BFS to conduct the Treasury Offset
Program (TOP). Through the TOP program, BFS may reduce your refund
(overpayment) and offset it to pay:

  * Past-due child support;
  * Federal agency nontax debts;
  * State income tax obligations; or
  * Certain unemployment compensation debts owed to a state (generally, these are debts for (1) compensation paid due to fraud, or (2) contributions owing to a state fund that weren't paid).

You can contact the agency with which you have a debt to determine if your
debt was submitted for a tax refund offset. You may call BFS's TOP call center
at the number below for an agency address and phone number. If your debt meets
submission criteria for offset, BFS will reduce your refund as needed to pay
off the debt you owe to the agency. Any portion of your remaining refund after
offset is issued in a check or direct deposited as originally requested on the
return.

BFS will send you a notice if an offset occurs. The notice will reflect the
original refund amount, your offset amount, the agency receiving the payment,
and the address and telephone number of the agency. BFS will notify the IRS of
the amount taken from your refund once your refund date has passed. You should
contact the agency shown on the notice if you believe you don't owe the debt
or if you're disputing the amount taken from your refund. Contact the IRS only
if your original refund amount shown on the BFS offset notice differs from the
refund amount shown on your tax return. If you don't receive a notice, contact
the BFS's TOP call center at [800-304-3107](tel:800-304-3107) (or TTY/TDD
[800-877-8339](tel:800-877-8339)), Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
CST.

## Injured spouse claim

If you filed a joint return and you're not responsible for debt that is
subject to offset because it is owed by your spouse, you're entitled to
request your portion of the refund back from the IRS. You may file a claim for
this amount by filing [Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation](/forms-
pubs/about-form-8379 "About Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation").

You may file Form 8379 in any of the following ways:

  * With your original joint tax return ([Form 1040](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040 "About Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return") or [Form 1040-SR](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-sr "About Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors")),
  * With your amended joint tax return ([Form 1040-X](/forms-pubs/about-form-1040x "About Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return")) if you are claiming a joint refund, or
  * By itself after you receive notification of an offset.

When filing a Form 8379 by mail either with your joint return or with an
amended return, write "Injured Spouse" in the top left corner of the first
page of the joint return.

The IRS can process your Form 8379 before an offset occurs. If you file Form
8379 with your original return, it may take 11 weeks to process an
electronically-filed return or 14 weeks if you filed a paper return. If you
file the Form 8379 by itself after a joint return has been processed, then
processing will take about 8 weeks. To avoid delays, be sure to follow the
[instructions for Form 8379 PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8379.pdf
"1123 Inst 8379                           \(PDF\)").

When filing Form 8379 by itself, you must show both spouses' taxpayer
identification numbers in the same order as they appeared on your joint income
tax return. You, the injured spouse, must sign the form. Follow the
instructions on Form 8379 carefully and be sure to attach the required Forms
W-2 and W-2G for both spouses and any Forms 1099 showing federal income tax
withholding to avoid delays. Don't attach the previously filed joint tax
return. Send Form 8379 to the [Service Center](/filing/where-to-file-paper-
tax-returns-with-or-without-a-payment "Where to file paper tax returns with or
without a payment") where you filed your original return and allow at least 8
weeks for the IRS to process your request. The IRS will compute the injured
spouse's share of the joint refund. If you lived in a community property state
during the tax year, the IRS will divide the joint refund based upon state
community property law. Not all debts are subject to a tax refund offset. To
determine whether an offset will occur on a debt owed (other than federal
tax), contact BFS's TOP call center at [800-304-3107](tel:800-304-3107)
([800-877-8339](tel:800-877-8339) for TTY/TDD help).

Treasury 


Internal 
Revenue 
Service 



31 U.S.C. §330. Practice before the Department 


(a) Subject to section 500 of title 5, the Secretary of the Treasury may — 

(1) regulate the practice of representatives of persons before the Department of the Treasury; and 
(2) before admitting a representative to practice, require that the representative demonstrate — 

(A) good character; 
(B) good reputation; 
(C) necessary qualifications to enable the representative to provide to persons valuable service; and 
(D) competency to advise and assist persons in presenting their cases. 


(b) After notice and opportunity for a proceeding, the Secretary may suspend or disbar from practice before the 
Department, or censure, a representative who — 

(1) is incompetent; 
(2) is disreputable; 
(3) violates regulations prescribed under this section; or 
(4) with intent to defraud, willfully and knowingly misleads or threatens the person being represented or a 
prospective person to be represented. 


The Secretary may impose a monetary penalty on any representative described in the preceding sentence. If the 
representative was acting on behalf of an employer or any firm or other entity in connection with the conduct 
giving rise to such penalty, the Secretary may impose a monetary penalty on such employer, firm, or entity if 
it knew, or reasonably should have known, of such conduct. Such penalty shall not exceed the gross income 
derived (or to be derived) from the conduct giving rise to the penalty and may be in addition to, or in lieu of, any 
suspension, disbarment, or censure of the representative. 


(c) After notice and opportunity for a hearing to any appraiser, the Secretary may — 

(1) provide that appraisals by such appraiser shall not have any probative effect in any administrative 
proceeding before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, and 

(2) bar such appraiser from presenting evidence or testimony in any such proceeding. 


(d) Nothing in this section or in any other provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the 
Secretary of the Treasury to impose standards applicable to the rendering of written advice with respect to any 
entity, transaction plan or arrangement, or other plan or arrangement, which is of a type which the Secretary 
determines as having a potential for tax avoidance or evasion.

grant enrollment as an enrolled agent or enrolled 
retirement plan agent to an applicant who, by virtue 
of past service and technical experience in the

that would justify the suspension or disbarment of 
any practitioner under the provisions of this part, 
under the following circumstances: 

(6) An applicant for enrollment as an enrolled 
retirement plan agent who is requesting such 
enrollment based on former employment with the 
Internal Revenue Service must have had a minimum

of this section, an aggregate of 10 or more years of 
employment in positions involving the application

the five years preceding the date of application, is the 
equivalent of five years continuous employment. 

(2) The appropriate office of the Internal Revenue 
Service provides a detailed report of the nature and 
rating of the applicant’s work while employed by 
the Internal Revenue Service and a recommendation 
whether such employment qualifies the applicant 
technically or otherwise for the desired authorization. 

(e) Natural persons. Enrollment to practice may be 
granted only to natural persons. 

(3) Enrollment as an enrolled agent based on an 
applicant’s former employment with the Internal 
Revenue Service may be of unlimited scope or it 
may be limited to permit the presentation of matters 
only of the particular specialty or only before the 
particular unit or division of the Internal Revenue 
Service for which the applicant’s former employment 
has qualified the applicant.  Enrollment as an enrolled 
retirement plan agent based on an applicant’s former 
employment with the Internal Revenue Service will 
be limited to permit the presentation of matters only 
with respect to qualified retirement plan matters. 

(f) Effective/applicability date.  This section is

if true, is not sufficient to warrant granting the

or delegate, has information indicating that the 
statements in the application are untrue or that the 
applicant would not otherwise qualify to become 
an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or 
registered tax return preparer.  Issuance of temporary

be heard with respect to the application. 

(d) Compliance and suitability checks. 

 

(1) As a condition to consideration of an

conduct a Federal tax compliance check and 
suitability check. The tax compliance check will be 
limited to an inquiry regarding whether an applicant 
has filed all required individual or business tax 
returns and whether the applicant has failed to pay, or 
make proper arrangements with the Internal Revenue 
Service for payment of, any Federal tax debts. 
The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry 
regarding whether an applicant has engaged in any 
conduct that would justify suspension or disbarment 
of any practitioner under the provisions of this part 
on the date the application is submitted, including 
whether the applicant has engaged in disreputable 
conduct as defined in §10.51. The application will 
be denied only if the results of the compliance or 
suitability check are sufficient to establish that the 
practitioner engaged in conduct subject to sanctions 
under §§10.51 and 10.52. 

(f) Protest of application denial. The applicant 
will be informed in writing as to the reason(s) for 
any denial of an application. The applicant may, 
within 30 days after receipt of the notice of denial of 
the application, file a written protest of the denial as 
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, 
guidance, or other appropriate guidance. A protest 
under this section is not governed by subpart D of 
this part. 

 


(f) Effective/applicability date.  This section is 
applicable to applications received on or after 
August 2, 2011. 


§ 10.6 Term and renewal of status as an enrolled 
agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or 
registered tax return preparer. 

 
 

(2) If the applicant does not pass the tax 
compliance or suitability check, the applicant will 
not be issued an enrollment or registration card or 
certificate pursuant to §10.6(b) of this part. An 
applicant who is initially denied enrollment or 
registration for failure to pass a tax compliance

qualified in the subject matter; 

(ii) Program subject matter must be current; 
(iii) Instructors, discussion leaders, and speakers 
must be qualified with respect to program content; 

(iii) Change in existing law. A change in 
existing law means the effective date of the statute or 
regulation, or date of entry of judicial decision, that

(iv) Programs must include some means for 
evaluation of the technical content and presentation 
to be evaluated; 

(b) Failure to comply. Compliance by a continuing 
education provider with the requirements of this part 
is determined by the Internal Revenue Service. A 
continuing education provider who fails to meet the 
requirements of this part will be notified by the Internal 
Revenue Service. The notice will state the basis for 
the determination of noncompliance and will provide 
the continuing education provider an opportunity to 
furnish the requested information in writing relating to 
the matter within 60 days of the date of the notice. The 
continuing education provider may, within 30 days after 
receipt of the notice of denial, file a written protest as 
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, 
instructions, or other appropriate guidance. A protest 
under this section is not governed by subpart D of this

qualified continuing education program number 
issued by the Internal Revenue Service must be 
provided to the participants who successfully 
complete the program; and

and attendance by each participant at each segment 
of the program. 

 (4) Program numbers — 

(i) In general. Every continuing education 
provider is required to obtain a continuing education 
provider program number and pay any applicable 
user fee for each program offered. Program 
numbers shall be obtained as prescribed by forms, 
instructions or other appropriate guidance. Although, 
at the discretion of the Internal Revenue Service, a 
continuing education provider may be required to 
demonstrate that the program is designed to enhance 
professional knowledge in Federal taxation or 
Federal tax related matters (programs comprised 
of current subject matter in Federal taxation or 
Federal tax related matters, including accounting, tax 
return preparation software, taxation, or ethics) and

believes in good faith and on reasonable grounds that 
the records or information are privileged. 

A practitioner who, having been retained by a 
client with respect to a matter administered by the 
Internal Revenue Service, knows that the client has 
not complied with the revenue laws of the United 
States or has made an error in or omission from any 
return, document, affidavit, or other paper which 
the client submitted or executed under the revenue 
laws of the United States, must advise the client 
promptly of the fact of such noncompliance, error, 
or omission. The practitioner must advise the client 
of the consequences as provided under the Code 
and regulations of such noncompliance, error, or 
omission. 

(2) Where the requested records or information 
are not in the possession of, or subject to the control 
of, the practitioner or the practitioner’s client, the 
practitioner must promptly notify the requesting 
Internal Revenue Service officer or employee and the 
practitioner must provide any information that the 
practitioner has regarding the identity of any person 
who the practitioner believes may have possession or 
control of the requested records or information. The 
practitioner must make reasonable inquiry of his or her 
client regarding the identity of any person who may 
have possession or control of the requested records 
or information, but the practitioner is not required to 
make inquiry of any other person or independently 
verify any information provided by the practitioner’s 
client regarding the identity of such persons.

Revenue Service matters; 

(3) When a proper and lawful request is made 
by a duly authorized officer or employee of the 
Internal Revenue Service, concerning an inquiry 
into an alleged violation of the regulations in this 
part, a practitioner must provide any information the 
practitioner has concerning the alleged violation and 
testify regarding this information in any proceeding 
instituted under this part, unless the practitioner 
believes in good faith and on reasonable grounds that 
the information is privileged. 

(2) In determining the correctness of oral or 
written representations made by the practitioner to 
the Department of the Treasury; and 

(3) In determining the correctness of oral or 
written representations made by the practitioner to 
clients with reference to any matter administered by 
the Internal Revenue Service. 

(b) Reliance on others.  Except as modified by 
§§10.34 and 10.37, a practitioner will be presumed 
to have exercised due diligence for purposes of 
this section if the practitioner relies on the work 
product of another person and the practitioner used 
reasonable care in engaging, supervising, training, 
and evaluating the person, taking proper account of 
the nature of the relationship between the practitioner 
and the person. 

(b) Interference with a proper and lawful request 
for records or information. A practitioner may not 
interfere, or attempt to interfere, with any proper 
and lawful effort by the Internal Revenue Service, 
its officers or employees, to obtain any record or 
information unless the practitioner believes in good

the development of which the former Government 
employee participated in, or for which, within a period 
of one year prior to the termination of Government 
employment, the former government employee had 
official responsibility. This paragraph (b)(4) does 
not, however, preclude any former employee from

materials provided to the practitioner, or obtained 
by the practitioner in the course of the practitioner’s 
representation of the client, that preexisted the 
retention of the practitioner by the client. The term also 
includes materials that were prepared by the client or a 
third party (not including an employee or agent of the 
practitioner) at any time and provided to the practitioner 
with respect to the subject matter of the representation. 
The term also includes any return, claim for refund, 
schedule, affidavit, appraisal or any other document 
prepared by the practitioner, or his or her employee or 
agent, that was presented to the client with respect to 
a prior representation if such document is necessary 
for the taxpayer to comply with his or her current 
Federal tax obligations. The term does not include any 
return, claim for refund, schedule, affidavit, appraisal 
or any other document prepared by the practitioner

includes tax planning and advice, preparing or filing 
or assisting in preparing or filing returns or claims 
for refund or credit, and all matters connected with 
a presentation to the Internal Revenue Service

§ 10.29 Conflicting interests. 


§ 10.28 Return of client’s records. 

 

(a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of 
this section, a practitioner shall not represent a 
client before the Internal Revenue Service if the 
representation involves a conflict of interest. A 
conflict of interest exists if — 

(a) In general, a practitioner must, at the request of 
a client, promptly return any and all records of the 
client that are necessary for the client to comply with 
his or her Federal tax obligations. The practitioner 
may retain copies of the records returned to a client. 
The existence of a dispute over fees generally does 
not relieve the practitioner of his or her responsibility 
under this section. Nevertheless, if applicable state law 
allows or permits the retention of a client’s records by 
a practitioner in the case of a dispute over fees for 
services rendered, the practitioner need only return 
those records that must be attached to the taxpayer’s 
return. The practitioner, however, must provide the 
client with reasonable access to review and copy 
any additional records of the client retained by the 
practitioner under state law that are necessary for the 
client to comply with his or her Federal tax obligations. 

 


(1) The representation of one client will be 
directly adverse to another client; or 

(2)There is a significant risk that the representation 
of one or more clients will be materially limited by 
the practitioner’s responsibilities to another client, 
a former client or a third person, or by a personal 
interest of the practitioner. 

(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a conflict 
of interest under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
practitioner may represent a client if — 

(1) The practitioner reasonably believes that the 
practitioner will be able to provide competent and 
diligent representation to each affected client; 

(2)  The representation is not prohibited by law;  

and  

(b) For purposes of this section — Records of the 
client include all documents or written or electronic 

(3) Each affected client waives the conflict of

of employment in matters related to the Internal 
Revenue Service if the solicitation violates Federal 
or State law or other applicable rule, e.g., attorneys 
are precluded from making a solicitation that is 
prohibited by conduct rules applicable to all attorneys 
in their State(s) of licensure. Any lawful solicitation 
made by or on behalf of a practitioner eligible to 
practice before the Internal Revenue Service must, 
nevertheless, clearly identify the solicitation as 
such and, if applicable, identify the source of the 
information used in choosing the recipient. 

interest and gives informed consent, confirmed 
in writing by each affected client, at the time the 
existence of the conflict of interest is known by the 
practitioner. The confirmation may be made within a 
reasonable period of time after the informed consent, 
but in no event later than 30 days. 

 


(c) Copies of the written consents must be retained 
by the practitioner for at least 36 months from the 
date of the conclusion of the representation of the 
affected clients, and the written consents must be 
provided to any officer or employee of the Internal 
Revenue Service on request. 

(b) Fee information. 

(1)(i) A practitioner may publish the availability 
of a written schedule of fees and disseminate the 
following fee information —

applicable on September 26, 2007. 


(A) Fixed fees for specific routine services. 
(B) Hourly rates. 
(C) Range of fees for particular services. 
(D) Fee charged for an initial consultation. 

§ 10.30 Solicitation. 

 


(a) Advertising and solicitation restrictions.  

(1) A practitioner may not, with respect to 
any Internal Revenue Service matter, in any way 
use or participate in the use of any form of public 
communication or private solicitation containing a 
false, fraudulent, or coercive statement or claim; or a 
misleading or deceptive statement or claim. Enrolled 
agents, enrolled retirement plan agents, or registered 
tax return preparers, in describing their professional 
designation, may not utilize the term “certified” or 
imply an employer/employee relationship with the 
Internal Revenue Service. Examples of acceptable 
descriptions for enrolled agents are “enrolled to 
represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue 
Service,” “enrolled to practice before the Internal 
Revenue Service,” and “admitted to practice before 
the Internal Revenue Service.” Similarly, examples 
of acceptable descriptions for enrolled retirement 
plan agents are “enrolled to represent taxpayers 
before the Internal Revenue Service as a retirement 
plan agent” and “enrolled to practice before the 
Internal Revenue Service as a retirement plan 
agent.” An example of an acceptable description for 
registered tax return preparers is “designated as a 
registered tax return preparer by the Internal Revenue 
Service.” 

 

(ii)Any statement of fee information concerning 
matters in which costs may be incurred must include 
a statement disclosing whether clients will be 
responsible for such costs. 

(2) A practitioner may charge no more than the 
rate(s) published under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section for at least 30 calendar days after the last date 
on which the schedule of fees was published. 

(c) Communication of fee information. Fee 
information may be communicated in professional 
lists, telephone directories, print media, mailings, 
and electronic mail, facsimile, hand delivered 
flyers, radio, television, and any other method. 
The method chosen, however, must not cause the 
communication to become untruthful, deceptive, 
or otherwise in violation of this part. A practitioner 
may not persist in attempting to contact a prospective 
client if the prospective client has made it known 
to the practitioner that he or she does not desire 
to be solicited. In the case of radio and television 
broadcasting, the broadcast must be recorded 
and the practitioner must retain a recording of the 
actual transmission. In the case of direct mail and 
e-commerce communications, the practitioner must 
retain a copy of the actual communication, along 
with a list or other description of persons to whom the

indirectly, an uninvited written or oral solicitation

regarding the terms of the engagement. For example, 
the advisor should determine the client’s expected 
purpose for and use of the advice and should have 
a clear understanding with the client regarding the 
form and scope of the advice or assistance to be 
rendered. 

communication was mailed or otherwise distributed. 
The copy must be retained by the practitioner for a 
period of at least 36 months from the date of the last 
transmission or use. 

(d) Improper associations.  A practitioner may not, 
in matters related to the Internal Revenue Service, 
assist, or accept assistance from, any person or entity 
who, to the knowledge of the practitioner, obtains 
clients or otherwise practices in a manner forbidden 
under this section. 

(2) Establishing the facts, determining which 
facts are relevant, evaluating the reasonableness 
of any assumptions or representations, relating the 
applicable law (including potentially applicable 
judicial doctrines) to the relevant facts, and arriving 
at a conclusion supported by the law and the facts. 

(e) Effective/applicability date.  This section is 
applicable beginning August 2, 2011. 

(3) Advising the client regarding the import of 
the conclusions reached, including, for example, 
whether a taxpayer may avoid accuracy-related 
penalties under the Internal Revenue Code if a 
taxpayer acts in reliance on the advice. 

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
under Control No. 1545-1726) 


 

§ 10.31 Negotiation of taxpayer checks.

(4) Acting fairly and with integrity in practice 
before the Internal Revenue Service. 

 (a) A practitioner may not endorse or otherwise 
negotiate any check (including directing or accepting 
payment by any means, electronic or otherwise, into 
an account owned or controlled by the practitioner or 
any firm or other entity with whom the practitioner 
is associated) issued to a client by the government in 
respect of a Federal tax liability. 

(b) Procedures to ensure best practices for tax 
advisors. Tax advisors with responsibility for 
overseeing a firm’s practice of providing advice 
concerning Federal tax issues or of preparing or 
assisting in the preparation of submissions to the 
Internal Revenue Service should take reasonable steps 
to ensure that the firm’s procedures for all members, 
associates, and employees are consistent with the best 
practices set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. 

 


(b) Effective/applicability date.  This section is 
applicable beginning June 12, 2014. 


 

§ 10.32 Practice of law.

documents, affidavits and other papers. 


 

§ 10.33 Best practices for tax advisors. 

(a) Tax returns. 

(1) A practitioner may not willfully, recklessly, or 
through gross incompetence — 

(a) Best practices.  Tax advisors should provide 
clients with the highest quality representation 
concerning Federal tax issues by adhering to best 
practices in providing advice and in preparing or 
assisting in the preparation of a submission to the 
Internal Revenue Service. In addition to compliance 
with the standards of practice provided elsewhere in 
this part, best practices include the following: 

(i) Sign a tax return or claim for refund that 
the practitioner knows or reasonably should know 
contains a position that — 

(A) Lacks a reasonable basis; 
(B) Is an unreasonable position as described 
in section 6694(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code 
(Code) (including the related regulations and other 
published guidance); or 

(1) Communicating clearly with the client

Table of Contents


(A) The practitioner advised the client with 
respect to the position; or 

(C) Is a willful attempt by the practitioner 
to understate the liability for tax or a reckless or 
intentional disregard of rules or regulations by the 
practitioner as described in section 6694(b)(2) of the 
Code (including the related regulations and other 
published guidance). 

(B) The practitioner prepared or signed the tax 
return; and 

(ii) Any document, affidavit or other paper 
submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. 

(2) The practitioner also must inform the client 
of any opportunity to avoid any such penalties by 
disclosure, if relevant, and of the requirements for 
adequate disclosure. 

(ii) Advise a client to take a position on a tax 
return or claim for refund, or prepare a portion of a 
tax return or claim for refund containing a position, 
that — 

(3) This paragraph (c) applies even if the 
practitioner is not subject to a penalty under the 
Internal Revenue Code with respect to the position 
or with respect to the document, affidavit or other 
paper submitted. 

(A) Lacks a reasonable basis; 
(B) Is an unreasonable position as described 
in section 6694(a)(2) of the Code (including the 
related regulations and other published guidance); or 

(C) Is a willful attempt by the practitioner 
to understate the liability for tax or a reckless or 
intentional disregard of rules or regulations by the 
practitioner as described in section 6694(b)(2) of the 
Code (including the related regulations and other 
published guidance). 

(d) Relying on information furnished by 
clients. A practitioner advising a client to take 
a position on a tax return, document, affidavit or 
other paper submitted to the Internal Revenue 
Service, or preparing or signing a tax return as a 
preparer, generally may rely in good faith without 
verification upon information furnished by the 
client. The practitioner may not, however, ignore the 
implications of information furnished to, or actually 
known by, the practitioner, and must make reasonable 
inquiries if the information as furnished appears to 
be incorrect, inconsistent with an important fact or 
another factual assumption, or incomplete. 

 


(2) A pattern of conduct is a factor that will 
be taken into account in determining whether a 
practitioner acted willfully, recklessly, or through 
gross incompetence.

(1) A practitioner may not advise a client to take 
a position on a document, affidavit or other paper 
submitted to the Internal Revenue Service unless the 
position is not frivolous.

this section is applicable for returns or claims for 
refund filed, or advice provided, beginning August 2,

submit a document, affidavit or other paper to the 
Internal Revenue Service — 

(i) The purpose of which is to delay or impede 
the administration of the Federal tax laws; 

(ii) That is frivolous; or 
(iii) That contains or omits information in a 
manner that demonstrates an intentional disregard 
of a rule or regulation unless the practitioner also 
advises the client to submit a document that evidences 
a good faith challenge to the rule or regulation.  

§ 10.35 Competence.

introduced false testimony during the proceedings 
against the respondent.

Administrative Law Judge, the nonmoving party 
is not required to file a response to a motion. If 
the Administrative Law Judge does not order 
the nonmoving party to file a response, and the 
nonmoving party files no response, the nonmoving 
party is deemed to oppose the motion. If a nonmoving 
party does not respond within 30 days of the filing 
of a motion for decision by default for failure to 
file a timely answer or for failure to prosecute, the 
nonmoving party is deemed not to oppose the motion.

before decision, may order or authorize amendment 
of the pleadings to conform to the evidence. The 
party who would otherwise be prejudiced by the

disclosed to, or open to inspection by, the public. 

(ii) Authorized orders.  

(a) In general.  The rules of evidence prevailing

The Administrative Law Judge may, however, 
exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, or 
unduly repetitious. 

(A) Upon motion by a party or any other 
affected person, and for good cause shown, the 
Administrative Law Judge may make any order 
which justice requires to protect any person in the 
event disclosure of information is prohibited by law, 
privileged, confidential, or sensitive in some other 
way, including, but not limited to, one or more of 
the following — 

(b) Depositions.  The deposition of any witness 
taken pursuant to §10.71 may be admitted into 
evidence in any proceeding instituted under §10.60. 

 
(1) That disclosure of information be made 
only on specified terms and conditions, including a 
designation of the time or place; 

(c) Requests for admission. Any matter admitted 
in response to a request for admission under 
§10.71 is conclusively established unless the 
Administrative Law Judge on motion permits 
withdrawal or modification of the admission. Any

not be disclosed, or be disclosed only in a designated 
way. 

(iii) Denials. If a motion for a protective order

the Administrative Law Judge deems just, order 
any party or person to comply with, or respond in 
accordance with, the procedure involved.

records, and papers of the Internal Revenue Service 
and the Office of Professional Responsibility are 
admissible in evidence without the production of

by a copy attested to or identified by an officer or 
employee of the Internal Revenue Service or the 
Treasury Department, as the case may be. 

 


(iv) Public inspection of documents. The 
Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, shall ensure 
that all names, addresses or other identifying details 
of third party taxpayers are redacted and replaced 
with the code assigned to the corresponding taxpayer 
in all documents prior to public inspection of such 
documents. 

(e) Withdrawal of exhibits. If any document, 
record, or other paper is introduced in evidence 
as an exhibit, the Administrative Law Judge may 
authorize the withdrawal of the exhibit subject to 
any conditions that he or she deems proper. 

(e) Location.  The location of the hearing will be 
determined by the agreement of the parties with the 
approval of the Administrative Law Judge, but, in 
the absence of such agreement and approval, the 
hearing will be held in Washington, D.C.

made in short form, stating the grounds for the 
objection. Except as ordered by the Administrative 
Law Judge, argument on objections will not be 
recorded or transcribed. Rulings on objections 
are to be a part of the record, but no exception to 
a ruling is necessary to preserve the rights of the 
parties. 

(f) Failure to appear.  If either party to the 
proceeding fails to appear at the hearing, after 
notice of the proceeding has been sent to him or her, 
the party will be deemed to have waived the right 
to a hearing and the Administrative Law Judge may 
make his or her decision against the absent party by 
default.

response, or if no written response is filed, within 
90 days after the motion for summary adjudication 
is filed. A  decision shall thereafter be rendered if 
the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and any 
other admissible evidence show that there is no 
genuine issue of material fact and that a decision 
may be rendered as a matter of law. The decision 
must include a statement of conclusions, as well as 
the reasons or basis for making such conclusions, 
and an order of censure, suspension, disbarment, 
monetary penalty, disqualification, or dismissal of 
the complaint. 

In cases where the hearing is stenographically 
reported by a Government contract reporter, copies 
of the transcript may be obtained from the reporter 
at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by 
contract between the Government and the reporter. 
Where the hearing is stenographically reported by a 
regular employee of the Internal Revenue Service, 
a copy will be supplied to the respondent either 
without charge or upon the payment of a reasonable 
fee. Copies of exhibits introduced at the hearing or 
at the taking of depositions will be supplied to the 
parties upon the payment of a reasonable fee (Sec. 
501, Public Law 82-137) (65 Stat. 290) (31 U.S.C. 
§ 483a). 

(3) Returns and return information.  In the 
decision, the Administrative Law Judge should 
use the code assigned to third party taxpayers 
(described in §10.72(d)). 

(b) Standard of proof. If the sanction is censure or 
a suspension of less than six months’ duration, the 
Administrative Law Judge, in rendering findings 
and conclusions, will consider an allegation of fact 
to be proven if it is established by the party who is 
alleging the fact by a preponderance of the evidence 
in the record. If the sanction is a monetary penalty, 
disbarment or a suspension of six months or longer 
duration, an allegation of fact that is necessary for 
a finding against the practitioner must be proven 
by clear and convincing evidence in the record. 
An allegation of fact that is necessary for a finding 
of disqualification against an appraiser must be 
proved by clear and convincing evidence in the 
record. 

§ 10.75 Proposed findings and conclusions. 

 

 


Except in cases where the respondent has failed to 
answer the complaint or where a party has failed to 
appear at the hearing, the parties must be afforded a 
reasonable opportunity to submit proposed findings 
and conclusions and their supporting reasons to the 
Administrative Law Judge.

decision must include a statement of findings 
and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis 
for making such findings and conclusions, and 
an order of censure, suspension, disbarment, 
monetary penalty, disqualification, or dismissal of 
the complaint.

§ 10.79 Effect of disbarment, suspension, or censure. 

 


 

(a) Disbarment. When the final decision in a case 
is against the respondent (or the respondent has 
offered his or her consent and such consent has been 
accepted by the Internal Revenue Service) and such 
decision is for disbarment, the respondent will not 
be permitted to practice before the Internal Revenue 
Service unless and until authorized to do so by the 
Internal Revenue Service pursuant to §10.81. 

(e) Additional time for briefs and responses. 
Notwithstanding the time for filing briefs and

determine the manner of giving notice to the proper 
authorities of the State by which the censured, 
suspended, or disbarred person was licensed to 
practice. 

and such decision is for suspension, the respondent 
will not be permitted to practice before the Internal 
Revenue Service during the period of suspension. 
For periods after the suspension, the practitioner’s 
future representations may be subject to conditions 
as authorized by paragraph (d) of this section. 

(b) Effective/applicability date. This section is 
applicable beginning August 2, 2011. 

(c) Censure. When the final decision in the case 
is against the respondent (or the Internal Revenue 
Service has accepted the respondent’s offer to 
consent, if such offer was made) and such decision 
is for censure, the respondent will be permitted to 
practice before the Internal Revenue Service, but the 
respondent’s future representations may be subject 
to conditions as authorized by paragraph (d) of this 
section. 

§ 10.81 Petition for reinstatement. 

 


(a) In general. A practitioner disbarred or 
suspended under §10.60, or suspended under 
§10.82, or a disqualified appraiser may petition 
for reinstatement before the Internal Revenue 
Service after the expiration of 5 years following 
such disbarment, suspension, or disqualification 
(or immediately following the expiration of the 
suspension or disqualification period, if shorter than 
5 years). Reinstatement will not be granted unless 
the Internal Revenue Service is satisfied that the 
petitioner is not likely to engage thereafter in conduct 
contrary to the regulations in this part, and that 
granting such reinstatement would not be contrary to 
the public interest. 

(d) Conditions. After being subject to the 
sanction of either suspension or censure, the future 
representations of a practitioner so sanctioned 
shall be subject to specified conditions designed 
to promote high standards of conduct. These 
conditions can be imposed for a reasonable 
period in light of the gravity of the practitioner’s 
violations. For example, where a practitioner is 
censured because the practitioner failed to advise 
the practitioner’s clients about a potential conflict 
of interest or failed to obtain the clients’ written 
consents, the practitioner may be required to 
provide the Internal Revenue Service with a copy 
of all consents obtained by the practitioner for an 
appropriate period following censure, whether or 
not such consents are specifically requested. 

(b) Effective/applicability date. This section is 
applicable beginning June 12, 2014.

(b) To whom applicable. This section applies to 
any practitioner who, within 5 years prior to the 
date that a show cause order under this section’s 
expedited suspension procedures is served:

(1) Individuals (and employers, firms, or other

Service or upon whom a monetary penalty was

"Taxpayer Bill of Rights 6: The Right to Finality").

## The Right to Privacy

necessary, and will respect all due process rights, including search and
seizure protections and will provide, where applicable, a collection due
process hearing.

[Learn more about your right to privacy](/newsroom/taxpayer-bill-of-rights-7
"Taxpayer Bill of Rights 7: The Right to Privacy").

employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose
taxpayer return information.

[Learn more about your right to confidentiality](/newsroom/taxpayer-bill-of-
rights-8 "Taxpayer Bill of Rights 8: The Right to Confidentiality").

## The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System

Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and
circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay,
or ability to provide information timely. Taxpayers have the right to receive
assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate Service if they are experiencing
financial difficulty or if the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly
and timely through its normal channels.

returns online using guided tax preparation software. It’s safe, easy and no
cost to you. Those who don’t qualify can still use Free File Fillable Forms.

gross-income "Definition of adjusted gross income") $79,000 or less)

Let the software do the work

  * Answer simple questions
  * Choose between trusted IRS partners you qualify for
  * Accurate math calculations guaranteed

### What is IRS Free File?

The IRS Free File Program is a public-private partnership between the IRS and
many tax preparation and filing software industry companies who provide their
online tax preparation and filing for free. It provides two ways for taxpayers
to prepare and file their federal income tax online for free:

  * **Guided Tax Software** provides free online tax preparation and filing at an IRS partner site. Our partners deliver this service at no cost to qualifying taxpayers. Taxpayers whose [AGI](/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income "Definition of adjusted gross income") is $79,000 or less qualify for a free federal tax return.
  * **Free File Fillable Forms** are electronic federal tax forms, equivalent to a paper 1040 form. You should know how to prepare your own tax return using form instructions and IRS publications if needed. It provides a free option to taxpayers whose [income (AGI)](/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income "Definition of adjusted gross income") is greater than $79,000.

### Free File help topics

Find what you need to get started, your protections and security, available
forms and more about IRS Free File.

#### How IRS Free File offers work

  2. Choose an IRS Free File option, guided tax software or Free File Fillable Forms.
  3. You will be directed to the IRS partner’s website to create a new account or if you are a previous user, log in to an existing account.
  4. Prepare and e-file your federal tax return.
  5. Receive an email when the IRS has accepted your return.

IRS Free File Program offers the [most commonly filed forms](/filing/free-
file-most-commonly-filed-federal-forms-are-available "Free File Most Commonly
Filed Federal Forms are Available").

#### About IRS Free File partnership with online tax preparation companies

The IRS Free File program is a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the
IRS and the Free File Alliance, a coalition of leading tax preparation
software companies. IRS Free File partners are online tax preparation
companies that offer what is called the “IRS Free File” program, which
provides free electronic tax preparation and filing of federal tax returns at
no cost to qualifying taxpayers (some may also offer free state returns). The
IRS Free File program PPP is not a traditional contractual arrangement; this
partnership represents a balance of joint responsibility and collaboration
that serves the interests of taxpayers and the Federal government. The online
tax preparation software partners are part of the [Free File
Alliance](/e-file-providers/about-the-free-file-alliance "Free File
Alliance"), which coordinates with the IRS to provide free electronic federal
tax preparation and filing to you. This non-profit, public-private partnership
is dedicated to helping millions of people prepare and file their federal
taxes online for free.

The IRS does not endorse any individual partner company.

#### What you need to get started

**Personal information you need**

  * A copy of last year's tax return in order to access your [AGI](/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income "Definition of adjusted gross income")
  * Valid Social Security numbers for yourself, your spouse, and any dependent, if applicable

**Income and receipts**

  * Social Security benefits
  * Unemployment Compensation
  * All receipts pertaining to your small business, if applicable
  * Income receipts from rental, real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporation, trusts

**Other income**

  * [W-2s](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-2 "About Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement "), showing your annual wages from all of your employers
  * [Form 1099-INT](/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-int "About Form 1099-INT, Interest Income"), showing interest paid to you throughout the year
  * [Form 1099-G](/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-g "About Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments"), showing any refund, credit or offset of state and local taxes
  * Forms [1099-DIV](/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-div "About Form 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions ") and [1099-R](/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-r "About Form 1099-R, Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc."), showing dividends and distributions from retirement and other plans paid to you during the year

**ACA filers**

  * [Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit](/forms-pubs/about-form-8962 "About Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit")

**File electronically**

  * When self-preparing your taxes and filing electronically, you must [sign and validate your electronic tax return](/individuals/validating-your-electronically-filed-tax-return "Validating your electronically filed tax return"). To verify your identity, use last year’s AGI or last year’s self-select signature personal identification number (PIN). To sign your electronic tax return, use a 5 digit self-select PIN, any five numbers (except all zeros) that you choose which serves as your electronic signature.
  * If you do not know last year’s AGI, have a copy of your prior year tax return, you can find that information by signing into your [online account](/payments/online-account-for-individuals "Online account for individuals"). This is the fastest and easiest way to view your prior year adjusted gross income (AGI) and access your tax records.
  * If you are unable to access your online account, you can get a [tax return transcript by mail](/individuals/get-transcript "Get your tax records and transcripts") showing your prior year AGI.

**Contact information**

  * To get a notification from the Free File software company that your return was accepted by IRS, you need a valid email address.

#### Information safety

Your information is protected from any unauthorized access while it is sent to
the IRS. Free File partner companies may not disclose or use tax return
information for purposes other than tax return preparation without your
informed and voluntary consent. These companies are also subject to the
Federal Trade Commission Privacy and Safeguards Rules and IRS e-file
regulations.

We do not collect or retain information about you when you use IRS Free File.
Our policy prohibits the use of permanent Internet cookies. We sometimes use
“temporary” or “session” cookies to make sure you are the correct recipient of
information you requested. These are deleted when your Internet visit ends.

#### Prior-year returns

Please note you can only file your current year tax return using IRS Free
File. You cannot process a prior year return using IRS Free File.

Prior year returns can only be filed electronically by [registered tax
preparers](/tax-professionals/understanding-tax-return-preparer-credentials-
and-qualifications "Understanding tax return preparer credentials and
qualifications") for the two previous tax years. The IRS does not allow
electronic filing for prior year returns through self-preparation websites.
You must print, sign, and mail prior year returns. Our [Directory of Federal
Tax Return Preparers with Credentials and Select
Qualifications](https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf "IRS Directory of Federal
Tax Return Preparers with Credentials and Select Qualifications") can help you
find preparers in your area who currently hold professional credentials
recognized by the IRS, or who hold an Annual Filing Season Program Record of

#### The benefits of the IRS Free File program

  * **You can obtain a free federal tax return:** If you are new to IRS Free File, you can choose an IRS Free File company’s Free File offer based on your review of the offer qualifications listed on IRS.gov. If you choose a program and qualify, you will not be charged for preparation and e-filing of a federal tax return. 
  * If you used IRS Free File last year, you will receive an email from the same company that you used, welcoming you back to their official IRS Free File services. The email must include a link to the company’s IRS Free File site and explain how to file with it. If you choose this email link and qualify, you will not be charged for preparation and e-filing of a federal tax return. 
  * **Fees to file your federal return are prohibited:** No participant in the IRS Free File Program will charge you anything to file your federal tax return if you qualify. You will not be asked to buy any products or services (for example, promotional rebates) in exchange for having your Federal tax return prepared by the Free File program participant. 
  * **Bank products with fees are not a part of IRS Free File.** As part of IRS Free File, you must not be offered bank products that often carry product fees, such as refund transfer products (e.g., refund anticipation loans (RALs)). 
  * **Free state returns may be available:** Some IRS Free File Program partner companies offer free state tax preparation. Others charge a state fee. Be sure to read each company’s information carefully. 
  * **Each IRS Free File Company Guarantees the Accuracy of the Return Calculations:** Each company lists this guarantee on its Free File website. You can pursue any accuracy concerns directly with the company that prepared your return. 
  * **You have choices:** If you don’t qualify for an IRS Free File offer after visiting a company’s Free File website, you can return to the IRS.gov Free File website to seek a Free File offer that may meet your needs. Each IRS Free File company will provide you information when you don’t qualify, with a link back to the IRS.gov Free File site. 
  * **Seek help if you need it:** If you need help when you are at a company’s IRS Free File site and doing your taxes, you may refer to the company’s free customer service options.

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) helps low- to moderate-income workers and
families get a tax break. If you qualify, you can use the credit to reduce the
taxes you owe – and maybe increase your refund.

Did you receive a letter from the IRS about the EITC? [Find out what to
do](/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/letter-or-audit-
for-eitc "Letter or audit for EITC").

## Who qualifies

You may claim the EITC if your income is low- to moderate. The amount of your
credit may change if you have children, dependents, are disabled or meet other
criteria.

Military and clergy should review our [Special EITC Rules](/credits-
deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/military-and-clergy-rules-for-
the-earned-income-tax-credit "Military and clergy rules for the Earned Income
Tax Credit") because using this credit may affect other government benefits.

[Check if You Qualify](/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-
credit/use-the-eitc-assistant "Use the EITC Assistant")

**If you claim this credit** , your [refund may be delayed](/credits-
deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/when-to-expect-your-refund-if-
you-claimed-the-earned-income-tax-credit-or-additional-child-tax-credit "When
to expect your refund if you claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit or
Additional Child Tax Credit"). By law, we must wait until mid-February to
issue refunds to taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit.

Thank you for visiting the Internal Revenue Service's website, an official
United States Government System, and reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy
policy explains how we handle the personally identifiable information (PII)
that you provide to us when you visit us online to browse, obtain information,
or conduct a transaction. PII includes information that is personal in nature
and which might be used to identify you. The IRS uses this website to provide
information about IRS services and programs. This website includes specific
applications which provide more services or enable us to respond to specific
questions from website visitors.

We won't collect personal information about you just because you visit this
Internet site. Some applications on this website provide you with the
opportunity to order forms, ask questions requiring a response, sign up for
electronic newsletters, participate in focus groups and customer surveys, or
learn the status of filed returns or anticipated payments. Using these
services is voluntary and may require that you provide additional personal
information to us. Providing the requested information implies your consent
for us to use this data in order to respond to your specific request.

## IRS privacy policy overview

#### Information we may collect

All personal information you provide to us is voluntary. We may collect
personal information about you (such as name, email address, Social Security
number or other unique identifier) only if you specifically and knowingly
provide it to us. We will use your information to process requests for certain
services or information. Providing your information is generally voluntary,
but if it is not provided, we might not be able to process your transaction.
When information is required, we will let you know before we collect it. We
publish specific information on records the IRS may collect in the IRS Privacy
Act System of Records Notices on the [U.S. Department of the Treasury System
of Records Notices](https://home.treasury.gov/footer/privacy-act/system-of-
records-notices-sorns) page.

#### Why we collect personal information

We collect PII and other information only as necessary to administer our
programs under the authority of the Internal Revenue Code and the protections
of the Code and the Privacy Act. The information you provide will be used only
for that purpose. We do not sell the information collected at this site or any
other information we collect. You do not have to give us personal information
to visit our website. For more information on authority, visit [The agency,
its mission and statutory authority](/about-irs/the-agency-its-mission-and-
statutory-authority "The agency, its mission and statutory authority") page.
We publish specific information on the purpose and authority for records the
IRS may collect in the IRS Privacy Act System of Records Notices on the [U.S.
Department of the Treasury System of Records
Notices](https://home.treasury.gov/footer/privacy-act/system-of-records-
notices-sorns) page.

#### How we use your personal information

Throughout our website, we will let you know if the information we ask you to
provide is voluntary or required. By providing your personal information, you
give us consent to use the information only for the purpose for which it was
collected. We describe those purposes when we collect information. We will ask
for your consent before using the information you provide for any secondary
purpose other than those required by federal law. We will disclose your
information only authorized by law and as listed in the routine uses published
in the IRS Privacy Act System of Records Notices on the [U.S. Department of
the Treasury System of Records
Notices](https://home.treasury.gov/footer/privacy-act/system-of-records-
notices-sorns) page.

We protect your information in a secure and readily accessible environment. We
also monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or
change information or otherwise cause damage to the web service. We focus on
web site security so that this service remains available to you and other
visitors. No attempts are made to identify individual users unless illegal
behavior is suspected. For more information on security, visit our [security
of your information](/privacy-disclosure/security-of-your-information
"Security of your information") page.

#### Umbrella privacy notice for tax returns

The various inquiries made of individuals by the IRS during tax administration
are part of a single process. Rather than include the same Privacy Act notice
information in many forms or letters that are repeated contacts with the same
individual about the same situation, the IRS has adopted an “umbrella”
approach where the first contact of a series includes a notice that the
individual may keep and that would apply to all future inquiries related to
that situation. This approach spares the recipient from receiving repetitious
and unnecessary identical notices.

**Disclosure, Privacy Act, and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice**

The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the Privacy Act of 1974, and the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 require that when we ask you for information,
we must first tell you our legal right to ask for the information, why we are
asking for it, and how it will be used. We must also tell you what could
happen if we do not receive it and whether your response is voluntary,
required to obtain a benefit, or mandatory under the law.

This notice applies to all records and other material (in paper or electronic
format) you file with us, including this tax return. It also applies to any
questions we need to ask you so we can complete, correct, or process your
return; figure your tax; and collect tax, interest, or penalties.

Our legal right to ask for information is Internal Revenue Code sections 6001,
6011, and 6012(a), and their regulations. They say that you must file a return
or statement with us for any tax you are liable for. Your response is
mandatory under these sections. Code section 6109 requires you to provide your
identifying number on the return. This is so we know who you are and can
process your return and other papers. You must fill in all parts of the tax
form that apply to you. But you do not have to check the boxes for the
Presidential Election Campaign Fund or for the third-party designee. You also
do not have to provide your daytime phone number or email address.

You are not required to provide the information requested on a form that is
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB
control number. Books or records relating to a form, or its instructions must
be retained as long as their contents may become material in the
administration of any Internal Revenue law.

We ask for tax return information to carry out the tax laws of the United
States. We need it to figure and collect the right amount of tax.

If you do not file a return, do not provide the information we ask for, or
provide fraudulent information, you may be charged penalties and be subject to
criminal prosecution. We may also have to disallow the exemptions, exclusions,
credits, deductions, or adjustments shown on the tax return. This could make
the tax higher or delay any refund. Interest may also be charged.

Generally, tax returns and return information are confidential, as stated in
Code section 6103. However, Code section 6103 allows or requires the Internal
Revenue Service to disclose or give the information shown on your tax return
to others as described in the Code. For example, we may disclose your tax
information to the Department of Justice to enforce the tax laws, both civil
and criminal, and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S.
commonwealths or territories to carry out their tax laws. We may disclose your
tax information to the Department of Treasury and contractors for tax
administration purposes; and to other persons as necessary to obtain
information needed to determine the amount of or to collect the tax you owe.
We may disclose your tax information to the Comptroller General of the United
States to permit the Comptroller General to review the Internal Revenue
Service. We may disclose your tax information to committees of Congress;
federal, state, and local child support agencies; and to other federal
agencies for the purposes of determining entitlement for benefits or the
eligibility for and the repayment of loans. We may also disclose this
information to other countries under a tax treaty, to federal and state
agencies to enforce federal nontax criminal laws, or to federal law
enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism.

Please keep this notice with your records. It may help you if we ask you for
other information. If you have questions about the rules for filing and giving
information, please call or visit any Internal Revenue Service office.

**We welcome comments on forms**

We try to create forms and instructions that can be easily understood. Often
this is difficult to do because our tax laws are very complex. For some people
with income mostly from wages, filling in the forms is easy. For others who
have businesses, pensions, stocks, rental income, or other investments, it is
more difficult.

If you have suggestions for making these forms simpler, we would be happy to
hear from you. You can send us comments through
[IRS.gov/formscomments](/forms-pubs/comment-on-tax-forms-and-publications
"Comment on tax forms and publications"). Or you can send your comments to
Internal Revenue Service, Tax Forms and Publications Division, 1111
Constitution Ave. NW, IR6526, Washington, DC 20224. Don’t send your return to
this address. Instead, see the addresses at the end of these instructions.

Although we can't respond individually to each comment received, we do
appreciate your feedback and will consider your comments as we revise our tax
forms and instructions.

**Estimates of taxpayer burden**

The following table shows burden estimates based on current statutory
requirements as of November 2023 for taxpayers filing a 2023 Form 1040 or
1040SR tax return. Time spent and out-of-pocket costs are presented
separately. Time burden is broken out by taxpayer activity, with recordkeeping
representing the largest component. Out-of-pocket costs include any expenses
incurred by taxpayers to prepare and submit their tax returns. Examples
include tax return preparation and submission fees, postage and photocopying
costs, and tax return preparation software costs. While these estimates don’t
include burden associated with post-filing activities, IRS operational data
indicate that electronically prepared and filed returns have fewer arithmetic
errors, implying lower post-filing burden.

Reported time and cost burdens are national averages and don’t necessarily
reflect a “typical” case. Most taxpayers experience lower than average burden,
with taxpayer burden varying considerably by taxpayer type. For instance, the
estimated average time burden for all taxpayers filing a Form 1040 or 1040SR
is 13 hours, with an average cost of $270 per return. This average includes
all associated forms and schedules, across all tax return preparation methods
and taxpayer activities.

Within this estimate, there is significant variation in taxpayer activity. For
example, nonbusiness taxpayers are expected to have an average burden of about
9 hours and $150, while business taxpayers are expected to have an average
burden of about 24 hours and $560. Similarly, tax return preparation fees and
other out-of-pocket costs vary extensively depending on the tax situation of
the taxpayer, the type of software or professional preparer used, and the
geographic location.

For more information on taxpayer burden see Pub. 5743. If you have comments
concerning the time and cost estimates below, you can contact us at either one
of the addresses shown under We Welcome Comments on Forms.

**Estimated average taxpayer burden (in hours) for individuals by activity**

Type of taxpayer \| Percentage of returns | Total time* | Record-keeping | Tax planning | Form completion and submission | All other | Average cost (dollars)**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All taxpayers | 100% | 13 | 6 | 2 | 4 | 1 | $270  
Nonbusiness taxpayers*** | 72% | 9 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 1 | $150  
Business taxpayers*** | 28% | 24 | 12 | 4 | 6 | 2 | $560  
  
*Detail may not add to total time due to rounding.

**Dollars rounded to the nearest $10.

***You are considered a “business” filer if you file one or more of the
following with Form 1040 or 1040-SR: Schedule C, E, or F or Form 2106. You are
considered a “nonbusiness” filer if you don’t file any of those schedules or
forms with Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

#### Meeting recordings

We protect your privacy in [online](/irm/part10/irm_10-005-001 "10.5.1 Privacy
Policy") and in-person meetings just as we do with all other interactions. We
make sure we authenticate all attendees’ identity, their authorization to be
in the meeting, and their need to know. The IRS might need to [record
](/irm/part10/irm_10-005-001#idm139957247987856 "10.5.1 Privacy Policy")a
meeting you attend, with your consent. Designated IRS hosts may record
meetings. If we do so, we will notify all participants we are recording. By
joining and staying in the recorded meeting, you consent to the recording. To
opt out of recording, you may leave a recorded meeting. If this is an in-

## Privacy compliance programs

#### Privacy and Civil Liberty Impact Assessments (PCLIA)

A PCLIA is a decision-making tool used to identify and mitigate privacy risks
at the beginning of and throughout the development life cycle of a program or
system. PCLIAs help the public understand what PII the agency is collecting,
why it is being collected, and how it will be used, shared, accessed, secured
and stored. The PCLIA uses the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) to
assess and mitigate any impact on an individual’s privacy. Generally, a PCLIA
is required before a program or system containing PII becomes operational.

Generally, a PCLIA should accomplish these goals:

  * Ensure conformance with applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements for privacy.
  * Determine the risks and effects.
  * Evaluate protections and alternative processes to mitigate potential privacy risks.
  * Provide assurance to the public about the protection of privacy and constitutional rights.

Approved PCLIAs are published on the IRS's [Privacy Impact
Assessments](/privacy-disclosure/privacy-impact-assessments-pia "Privacy
Impact Assessments - PIA") page unless they are classified.

#### System of records notice (SORN)

A System of Records is a group of records under the control of any federal
agency from which information is retrieved by a unique personal identifier
assigned to an individual. A SORN is a formal notice to the public published
in the Federal Register that identifies the purpose for which PII is
collected, from whom and what type of PII is collected, how the PII is shared
externally (routine uses), and how to access and correct any PII maintained by
the department or agency.

A SORN is required when a government agency has a system of records as defined
above. In some instances, the agency may have an existing SORN that covers a
collection of systems or programs.

All SORNs are approved by the agency’s Chief Privacy Officer prior to
publication and are sent to OMB and Congress for comment. After, they are
published in the Federal Register for thirty days to give the public notice
and time to comment. A program or system may not become operational until the
SORN has been published for 30 days.

All IRS SORNs published in the Federal Register can be found on the [U.S. Department of the Treasury System of Records Notices](https://home.treasury.gov/footer/privacy-act/system-of-records-notices-sorns "U.S. Department of the Treasury | System of Records Notices \(SORNs\)") webpage. There is a section labeled “Exemptions claimed for the system” that lists any exemptions to the Privacy Act at the end of each SORN.

#### Computer matching agreements

A computer matching program is required by the Privacy Act for any
computerized comparison of two or more automated systems of records, or a
system of records with non-federal records, for establishing or verifying
eligibility or compliance as it relates to cash or in-kind assistance or
payments under federal benefit programs.

Notices for approved computer matching programs are published in the Federal
Register and can be found on the [U.S. Department of the Treasury Computer
Matching Programs](https://home.treasury.gov/footer/privacy-act/computer-
matching-programs) webpage. There are exemptions for computer matching
agreements for internal systems used for tax administration purposes.

#### Publicly available privacy reports

In accordance with Section 522 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005,
the Department of the Treasury prepares a report to Congress on an annual
basis covering the Department’s activities which affect privacy. These
activities include complaints of privacy violations, implementation of section
552a of title 5, 11 United States Code, internal controls, as well as other
relevant matters. A listing of all publicly available privacy reports can be
found at the [U.S. Department of the Treasury Privacy Act Annual
Reports](https://home.treasury.gov/footer/privacy-act/privacy-reports)
webpage.

#### Privacy Act implementation rules and exemptions

Information on IRS Privacy Act Implementation Rules can be found at the
[Federal Register Privacy Act Implementation for the U.S. Department of the
Treasury](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/03/07/2014-04946/privacy-
act-implementation).

Exemptions to the Privacy Act can be found near the end of each individual
SORN, in the “Exemptions claimed for the system,” as well as in [Treasury
Regulation 31 CFR
1.36](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2004-title31-vol1/CFR-2004-title31-vol1-sec1-36).

#### IRS Privacy Program Plan

Ensuring the IRS preserves and enhances public confidence by properly
protecting, retaining and disclosing taxpayer information is the main purpose
of the [IRS Privacy Program Plan PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-
pdf/p5499.pdf "0224 Publ 5499                           \(PDF\)").

The plan provides an overview of the:

  * IRS’s privacy protection responsibilities
  * A description of the structure of the privacy program
  * Resources dedicated to the privacy program
  * Role of the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) and other privacy officials and staff
  * Strategic goals and objectives of the privacy program
  * Management controls in place or planned for meeting applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risks
  * Information necessary by the agency’s privacy requirements

## Privacy Act requests

#### Overview

**Note:** Federal tax records are exempt from access or amendment. To amend a
federal tax record, taxpayers must file [Form 1040-X](/forms-pubs/about-
form-1040x "About Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return") or
follow IRS procedures for other changes, such as [change of
address](/faqs/irs-procedures/address-changes/address-changes "Address
changes").

The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, provides safeguards against unwarranted
invasions of privacy by establishing a code of "fair information practices."
The principles, commonly referenced as the fair information practice
principles (FIPPs), require agencies to comply with statutory norms for
collection, maintenance, access, use, and dissemination of records.

To increase transparency and assure notice to individuals, the Privacy Act
requires agencies to publish in the Federal Register notice of modifications
to or the creation of systems of records. The term "system of records" means a
group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is
retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol,
or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.

A current listing of the Department's System of Records, along with updated
routine uses and claimed exemptions, can be found the on the [Treasury
Department's System of Records
Notices](https://home.treasury.gov/footer/privacy-act/system-of-records-
notices-sorns) page.

To further protect the individual, the Privacy Act requires all records which
are used by the agency in making any determination about any individual to be
maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is
reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the
determination.

The Privacy Act grants individuals increased rights of access to records
maintained about them, as well as the right to seek amendment of records
maintained about them.

IRS offers routine access to other records through [procedures designed to
make access quick and easy](/privacy-disclosure/routine-access-to-irs-records
"Routine access to IRS records"). If you are working directly with an IRS
employee on an open tax case, you can request information from the file
directly from them.

#### How to make a Privacy Act request

To request to access your Privacy Act records electronically, complete [Form
15603, IRS Request for Individual Access to Non-Tax Records Protected under
the Privacy Act PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f15603.pdf "0724 Form
15603                          \(PDF\)"), and submit it on the [FOIA and
Privacy Act Public Access
Portal](https://foiapublicaccessportal.for.irs.gov/app/Home.aspx "IRS FOIA
Public Access Portal").

To give consent to disclose your Privacy Act records electronically, complete

## Privacy complaints

#### What is a privacy complaint?

A privacy complaint is a written allegation filed with the Service's [Office
of Privacy, Governmental Liaison and Disclosure](/about-irs/privacy-
governmental-liaison-and-disclosure-at-a-glance "Privacy, Governmental Liaison
and Disclosure at a glance"), regarding a potential problem or violation of
privacy protections in the administration of IRS programs and operations that
may cause harm or violation of your personal or information privacy. This
complaint or inquiry may concern:

  * Issues regarding consent, collection, and appropriate notice
  * Issues regarding unauthorized disclosures
  * General IRS privacy policy and procedures

#### Before you submit a privacy complaint

The Office of Privacy, Governmental Liaison and Disclosure can't assist you
with any type of tax matter. We may only address questions about IRS privacy
policies or complaints you may have regarding how IRS uses and collects
personal information. Do not send in any sensitive information through this
correspondence.

Please include as much information as possible to help with our research and
response to your query, as appropriate and known. Include the date of the
incident, the date of discovery, and what personal information was affected.
IRS takes your privacy concerns very seriously and will respond fully and
timely. Please allow up to four weeks for a written response to your complaint
or inquiry, so that we have time to research and resolve.

#### Where to write

Write the Director, Office of Privacy, Governmental Liaison and Disclosure if
you have any questions or comments regarding the IRS website's privacy policy
or to submit a privacy complaint.

Director, Office of Privacy, Governmental Liaison and Disclosure

against anyone because of age, sex, color, disability, race, religion, and

stance also applies to anyone who volunteers or works with taxpayers in one of
our assisted programs:

  * Low Income Tax Clinics (LITC)
  * Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)
  * Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE)

## Taxpayer civil rights publications

## Making a request

If you are a taxpayer with a disability who needs a reasonable accommodation,
or you have limited English proficiency and require language assistance,
inform the IRS employee that you are working with about your need for
assistance. In addition, if you encounter an individual that volunteers or
works at a LITC, VITA or TCE site, inform the individual about your need for a
reasonable accommodation or language assistance.

To receive correspondence from the IRS in your preferred language, complete
and submit [Schedule LEP PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040lep.pdf
"1223 Form 1040 \(Schedule LEP\)            \(PDF\)") with your tax return. If
you have a visual impairment and would like to receive correspondence from the
IRS in an alternative media format such as Braille, large print, audio or
electronic formats, complete and send [Form 9000

\(PDF\)") to the following:

Department of the Treasury

## How they work

You can claim credits and deductions when you file your tax return to lower
your tax. Make sure you get all the credits and deductions you qualify for. If
you have qualified [dependents](/credits-deductions/individuals/dependents
"Dependents "), you may be eligible for certain credits and deductions.

## Claim credits

A credit is an amount you subtract from the tax you owe. This can lower your
tax payment or increase your refund. Some credits are [refundable](/credits-
deductions/individuals/refundable-tax-credits "Refundable tax credits") — they
can give you money back even if you don't owe any tax.

To claim credits, answer questions in your tax filing software. If you file a
paper return, you’ll need to complete a form and attach it.

### Here are credits you can claim:

#### If you earn under a certain income level

See if you qualify for the [Earned Income Tax Credit](/credits-
deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc "Earned Income Tax Credit
\(EITC\)"). This is a refundable credit, so you can get back more than you pay
in taxes. If you qualify, you can claim it even if you don’t normally file
taxes or aren’t required to file.

#### If you’re a parent or caretaker

Find credits if you:

[Have children or other dependents](/credits-deductions/individuals/child-tax-
credit "Child Tax Credit")

[Adopt a child](/taxtopics/tc607 "Topic no. 607, Adoption credit and adoption
assistance programs")

[Pay for childcare or dependent care](/credits-deductions/individuals/child-
and-dependent-care-credit-information "Child and Dependent Care Credit
information")

#### If you pay for higher education

[See if you qualify for an education credit](/credits-
deductions/individuals/education-credits-aotc-llc "Education Credits AOTC
LLC")

#### If you put money into retirement savings

[See if you qualify for the saver’s credit](/retirement-plans/plan-
participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-credit-savers-credit
"Retirement Savings Contributions Credit \(Saver’s Credit\)")

#### If you invest in clean vehicles or clean home energy

Find credits if you:

[Buy a clean (electric or hybrid) vehicle](/clean-vehicle-tax-credits "Clean
vehicle tax credits")

[Make home energy improvements](/credits-deductions/home-energy-tax-credits
"Home energy tax credits")

#### If you buy health insurance in the marketplace

[See if you qualify for the Premium Tax Credit](/affordable-care-
act/individuals-and-families/the-premium-tax-credit-the-basics "The Premium
Tax Credit – The basics"). Learn how to [correct your rejected e-filed return
for a missing Form 8962](/newsroom/how-to-correct-an-electronically-filed-
return-rejected-for-a-missing-form-8962 "How to correct an electronically
filed return rejected for a missing Form 8962").

#### If you qualify for other personal tax credits

Find less common credits for people who:

[Paid taxes overseas](/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-tax-credit
"Foreign Tax Credit")

[Overpaid Social Security or RRTA tax](/taxtopics/tc608 "Topic no. 608, Excess
Social Security and RRTA tax withheld")

[Paid alternative minimum tax in prior years](/forms-pubs/about-form-8801
"About Form 8801, Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax - Individuals, Estates,
and Trusts")

[Paid tax on undistributed capital gains](/forms-pubs/about-form-2438 "About
Form 2438, Undistributed Capital Gains Tax Return")

## Take deductions

A deduction is an amount you subtract from your income when you file so you
don’t pay tax on it. By lowering your income, deductions lower your tax.

You need documents to show expenses or losses you want to deduct. Your tax
software will calculate deductions for you and enter them in the right forms.
If you file a paper return, your deductions go on Form 1040 and may require
extra forms.

### Standard vs. itemized deductions

Most people take the standard deduction, which lets you subtract a set amount
from your income based on your [filing status](/filing/filing-status "Filing
status").

If your [deductible expenses and
losses](/publications/p17#en_US_2023_publink1000172998 "Publication 17
\(2023\), Your Federal Income Tax") are more than the standard deduction, you
can save money by deducting them one-by-one from your income (itemizing). Tax
software can walk you through your expenses and losses to show the option that
gives you the lowest tax.

Some people, including nonresidents and partial-year filers, [can’t take the
standard deduction](/publications/p17#en_US_2023_publink1000172998
"Publication 17 \(2023\), Your Federal Income Tax").

### Standard deduction amounts

The standard deduction for 2023 is:

  * $13,850 for single or married filing separately 

  * $27,700 for married couples filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse 

  * $20,800 for head of household 

Find the standard deduction if you’re:

  * [Over 65 or blind](/publications/p501#en_US_2023_publink100033487 "Publication 501 \(2023\),  Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information")
  * [A dependent on someone else’s tax return](/publications/p501#en_US_2023_publink100033487 "Publication 501 \(2023\),  Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information")

If you’re married filing separately, you can’t take the standard deduction if
your spouse itemizes. You must both choose the same method.

### Deductible expenses

You can deduct these expenses whether you take the standard deduction or
itemize:

  * [Alimony payments](/taxtopics/tc452 "Topic no. 452, Alimony and separate maintenance")
  * [Business use of your car](/taxtopics/tc510 "Topic no. 510, Business use of car")

  * [Penalties on early withdrawals from savings](/instructions/i1040gi#en_US_2023_publink10002112 "1040 \(2023\) ")

  * For military servicemembers: [moving expenses](/help/ita/can-i-deduct-my-moving-expenses "Can I deduct my moving expenses?")

If you itemize, you can deduct these expenses:

  * [Bad debts](/taxtopics/tc453 "Topic no. 453, Bad debt deduction")
  * [Canceled debt on home](/help/ita/how-do-i-report-the-debt-forgiven-on-my-residence-due-to-foreclosure-repossession-abandonment-or-because-of-a-loan-modification-or-short-sale "How do I report the debt forgiven on my residence due to foreclosure, repossession, abandonment, or because of a loan modification or short sale?")

The Child Tax Credit helps families with qualifying children get a tax break.
You may be able to claim the credit even if you don't normally file a tax
return.

## Who qualifies

You can claim the Child Tax Credit for each qualifying child who has a Social
Security number that is valid for employment in the United States.

To be a qualifying child for the 2023 tax year, your dependent generally must:

  * Be under age 17 at the end of the year
  * Be your son, daughter, stepchild, eligible foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, half-sister, or a descendant of one of these (for example, a grandchild, niece or nephew)
  * Provide no more than half of their own financial support during the year
  * Have lived with you for more than half the year
  * Be properly claimed as your dependent on your tax return
  * Not file a joint return with their spouse for the tax year **or** file it only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid
  * Have been a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or U.S. resident alien

You qualify for the full amount of the 2023 Child Tax Credit for each
qualifying child if you meet all eligibility factors and your annual income is
not more than $200,000 ($400,000 if filing a joint return).

Parents and guardians with higher incomes may be eligible to claim a partial
credit.

Use our Interactive Tax Assistant to [check if you qualify](/help/ita/does-my-
childdependent-qualify-for-the-child-tax-credit-or-the-credit-for-other-
dependents "Does my child/dependent qualify for the child tax credit or the
credit for other dependents?").

## How to claim this credit

You can claim the Child Tax Credit by entering your children and other
dependents on [Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return](/forms-
pubs/about-form-1040 "About Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return"),
and attaching a completed [Schedule 8812, Credits for Qualifying Children and
Other Dependents](/forms-pubs/about-schedule-8812-form-1040 "About Schedule
8812 \(Form 1040\), Credits for Qualifying Children and Other Dependents").

credits:

  * [Education credits](/credits-deductions/individuals/education-credits-aotc-llc "Education Credits AOTC LLC")

You may qualify for the [Credit for Other Dependents](/help/ita/does-my-
childdependent-qualify-for-the-child-tax-credit-or-the-credit-for-other-
dependents "Does my child/dependent qualify for the child tax credit or the
credit for other dependents?") for a child or dependent who is not a
"qualifying child" for purposes of the Child Tax Credit.

## New guidance: Tribal general welfare exclusion

The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) have issued a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)
PDF](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-20826.pdf) to
implement section 139E of the Internal Revenue Code, created by the Tribal
General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014 (Act). Additionally, Treasury announced
it will hold Tribal consultations on the proposed rule on **November 18, 19,
and 20, 2024, at 1 p.m. ET**.

Treasury is accepting written comments received by **December 17, 2024, 11:59
p.m. Alaska Time**. Please submit written comments at
[tribal.consult@treasury.gov](mailto:tribal.consult@treasury.gov).

## Treasury and IRS issue proposed regulations providing clarity regarding the
federal tax classification of entities entirely owned by Tribal governments

The Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued
[proposed
regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/10/09/2024-23142/entities-
wholly-owned-by-indian-tribal-governments) addressing the federal tax
classification of corporations or LLCs that are owned entirely by Indian
Tribal governments (Tribes) and formed under the laws of the Tribes that own
them.

Under the proposed regulations, Tribal law entities that are entirely owned by
Tribes would not be recognized as separate entities for federal tax purposes
and would not be subject to federal income tax.

The proposed regulations would also clarify that Tribal law entities entirely
owned by Tribes may receive the value of certain energy credits under the
Inflation Reduction Act.

Until the final regulations are published in the Federal Register, Tribes and
related entities may generally rely on these proposed regulations.

Treasury and IRS encourage interested parties to submit comments on this
guidance through [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/
"Regulations.gov - Your Voice in Federal Decision Making"). Please indicate
IRS and REG-113628-21 in the submission.

Also, written comments may be mailed to:

Internal Revenue Service  
CC:PA:01:PR (REG-113628-21), Room 5203  
P.O. Box 7604, Ben Franklin Station  
Washington, DC 20044

Treasury is accepting written comments received by **January 7, 2025, 11:59
p.m. Alaska Time**.

Additionally, Treasury announced it will hold Tribal consultations on the
proposed rule on **December 16, 17, and 18, 2024, at 1 p.m. ET**.

Learn to prepare taxes and make a difference in your community at the same
time. How can you make a difference? Simple. Volunteer to help your community
by preparing taxes free of charge with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance
(VITA) or Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Programs.

You will receive training to provide free tax help for low-to-moderate income
families who need assistance preparing their tax returns. As a volunteer, you
will join the thousands of others who each year prepare millions of tax
returns at thousands of tax sites nationwide.

If you have an interest in partnering with us to sponsor or host a free tax
preparation site in your area you can also complete and submit the [VITA/TCE
Volunteer and Partner Sign
Up](https://irsresearch.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3flwmoq06xW5Xvg
"VITA/TCE Volunteer and Partner Signup") form and we will be sure to follow-up
on your inquiry.

As a committed tax volunteer, you’ll be assigned to work with a sponsoring
organization, first to receive training and then to begin volunteering at a
location in your community. Training is offered both online and in the
classroom. Tax sites are generally open nights and weekends, and the hours are
flexible. You will surely find a volunteer site close to you.

## Interested?

For additional information and next steps, submit your inquiry now using the
[VITA/TCE Volunteer and Partner Sign
Up](https://irsresearch.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3flwmoq06xW5Xvg
"VITA/TCE Volunteer and Partner Signup") form and you will be one step closer
to becoming a VITA or TCE tax volunteer and giving back to your community. We
will share your volunteer interest with sponsoring organizations in your area
for follow-up contact.

## Limited service: Nov. 9 and 10

We’re making planned updates. This service is unavailable during these times:

  * Nov. 9, 1 a.m.-3 p.m. ET
  * Nov. 10, 1 a.m.-9 p.m. ET

Thank you for your patience.

If you are a qualified taxpayer or authorized representative (Power of
Attorney) you can apply for a payment plan (including installment agreement)
online to pay off your balance over time.

**Note:** Once you complete your online application you will receive immediate
notification of whether your payment plan has been approved.

## Individual payment plan

#### Do you qualify?

Your specific tax situation will determine which payment options are available
to you. Payment options include full payment, a short-term payment plan
(paying in 180 days or less) or a long-term payment plan (installment
agreement) (paying monthly).

You may qualify to apply online if:

  * Long-term payment plan (installment agreement): You owe $50,000 or less in combined tax, penalties and interest. You have filed all required returns.
  * Short-term payment plan: You owe less than $100,000 in combined tax, penalties and interest.

If you are a sole proprietor or independent contractor, apply for a payment
plan as an individual.

**Note:** Setup fees may be higher if you apply for a payment plan by phone,
mail, or in-person. [Get more information on other payment plan options and
fees](/node/16735#costs "Get more information on other payment plan options
and fees.").

#### What do you need to apply for a payment plan?

Starting November 14, 2021, IRS usernames that were only used to access
payment plans (Online Payment Agreement) can’t be used to sign in anymore. You
will be prompted to create an account with ID.me and will need photo
identification.

If you are applying for a direct debit payment plan, you will need your bank
routing and account numbers.

If you recently filed your tax return or your return was examined but have not
received a balance notice from the IRS, you will need the balance due shown on
your return.

#### What does it cost?

If we approve your payment plan, one of the following fees will be added to
your tax bill.

#### How do I review or revise an existing plan?

_**Reviewing a payment plan**_

You can view details of your current payment plan (type of agreement, due
dates, and amount you need to pay) by logging into the online payment
agreement tool using the [Apply/Revise button](/node/16716#heading003
"Apply/Revise Button") below.

_**What you can change using the online payment agreement tool**_

You can use the online payment agreement tool to make the following changes:

  * Change your monthly payment amount
  * Change your monthly payment due date
  * Convert an existing agreement to a Direct Debit agreement
  * Change the bank routing and account number on a Direct Debit agreement
  * Reinstate after default

You can log into the online payment agreement tool using the [Apply/Revise
button](/node/16716#heading003 "Apply/Revise Button") below.

_**How to revise an online payment plan**_

Log in to the online payment agreement tool using the [Apply/Revise
button](/node/16716#heading003 "Apply/Revise Button") below. On the first
page, you can revise your current plan type, payment date, and amount. Then
submit your changes.

If your new monthly payment amount does not meet the requirements, you will be
prompted to revise the payment amount. If you are unable to make the minimum
required payment amount, you will receive directions for completing a [Form
9465 Installment Agreement Request PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-
pdf/f9465.pdf "0920 Form 9465                           \(PDF\)") and [Form

pdf/f433f.pdf "0219 Form 433-F                          \(PDF\)").

To convert your current agreement to a Direct Debit agreement, or to make
changes to the bank account associated with your existing Direct Debit
agreement, enter your bank routing and account number.

If your plan has lapsed through default and is being reinstated, you may incur
a reinstatement fee.

#### How do I review or revise an existing plan?

_**Reviewing a payment plan**_

You can view details of your current payment plan (type of agreement, due
dates, and amount you need to pay) by logging into the online payment
agreement tool using the [Apply/Revise button](/node/16716#heading006
"Apply/Revise Button") below.

_**What you can change using the online payment agreement tool**_

You can use the online payment agreement tool to make the following changes:

  * Change your monthly payment amount
  * Change your monthly payment due date
  * Convert an existing agreement to a Direct Debit agreement
  * Change the bank routing and account number on a Direct Debit agreement
  * Reinstate after default

You can log into the online payment agreement tool using the [Apply/Revise
button](/node/16716#heading006 "Apply/Revise Button") below.

_**How to revise an online payment plan**_

Log in to the online payment agreement tool using the [Apply/Revise
button](/node/16716#heading006 "Apply/Revise Button") below. On the first
page, you can revise your current plan type, payment date, and amount. Then
submit your changes.

If your new monthly payment amount does not meet the requirements, you will be
prompted to revise the payment amount. If you are unable to make the minimum
required payment amount, you will receive directions for completing a [Form
433-B Collection Information Statement for Businesses
PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f433b.pdf "0219 Form 433-B
\(PDF\)") and how to submit it.

To convert your current agreement to a Direct Debit agreement, or to make
changes to the bank account associated with your existing Direct Debit
agreement, enter your bank routing and account number.

If your plan has lapsed through default and is being reinstated, you may incur
a reinstatement fee.

#### Power of Attorney (POA) for a business

To apply as Power of Attorney (POA) for a business, you need to log in with
your IRS username or ID.me credentials (see What do you need to apply for a
payment plan?)

You also need:

  * Taxpayer's Employer Identification Number (EIN)
  * Your [Centralized Authorization File (CAF)](/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/what-is-a-caf-number "What is a CAF number?") number
  * Caller ID from the taxpayer's notice or POA's signature date on [Form 2848](/forms-pubs/about-form-2848 "About Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative")
  * If the taxpayer’s return was recently filed or examined, you may also need: 
    * Business address of most recently filed tax return on file
    * Tax form filed or examined
    * Tax period filed or examined
    * Balance due amount

**Note** : The POA must be authorized for all balance due periods in order to
represent the taxpayer for a payment plan. Not all POA authority designation
levels can represent the taxpayer for this purpose (including level “h”) or
use the online system (including level “k”). See the [Instructions for Form
2848](/instructions/i2848 "Instructions for Form 2848 \(09/2021\) ") for more
information.
